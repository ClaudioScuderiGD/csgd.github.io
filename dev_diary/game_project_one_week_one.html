								<!-- DAY 1 -->
								<h3>Monday, November 14th</h3>
								<p>The very first day of the game project started with getting instructions for the assignment from our supervisors. Following this lecture, the team decided on roles for our members well as establishing a basic vision for gameplay and art, making sure we were all on the same page. Ideas about features to add, remove and change, were discussed and added to the documentation. Together with the lead programmer and lead artist, I started working with the team to distribute the workload. When I could find some spare time, I busied myself with writing the GDD from the ground up. After lunch the team held another meeting where we brainstormed further, discussed limitations and possibilities, set the scope for the game and worked on a more polished game idea. <br><br>Victor made a basic shotgun and some environmental mock-ups. Oskar worked on the main character, Morris.</p>

								<!-- DAY 2 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Tuesday, November 15th</h3>
								<p>I held a meeting first thing in the morning of the second day, where the team discussed how the previous day's work went, any issues and questions they wanted help with, and what they would work on during the day. Following the meeting, we attended a lecture about source control in Unreal. I worked on the GDD whenvever I could find some time. After lunch, we held a meeting discussing the art direction of the game, and held a discussion about the gameplay design and overall vision. <br><br>
								During a one-on-one meeting, my co-designer Hari Murali and I determined that the player's choices did not feel impactful enough. We developed a new, simple system aimed at giving the player more opportunities to weigh their decisions against each other before making one choice over another. Our hope was that this would make the player's choices feel more meaningful. We then discussed this system with the programmers during a meeting. In this meeting we also discussed a system for pick-ups, some potential Easter eggs, and how rooms would reward the player. Further, we were informed by the programmers that implementing procedural generation could be implemented smoothly.</p>
								<!-- DAY 3 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Wednesday, November 16th</h3>
								<p>I again held a meeting in the morning where the previous and current day's work was discussed. I then got to working on the GDD, where I focused on writing down a detailed description for how the currency and shop systems should work. My co-designer Hari and I then worked further on level design and layout for a few hours, and discussed the changes with our lead programmer. After testing how some similar games had handled level structure, we decided to change the approach we had been thinking of to something that was similar but that we were more happy with. After lunch the lead programmer and I started testing source control within Unreal, running into some issues. Once these were resolved I went back to writing on the design document, now focusing on writing the segment for how each of the different kinds of rooms work and why we designed them as they are.</p>
