								<!-- DAY 1 -->
								<h3>Monday</h3>
								<p>Monday started with getting instructions from our supervisors on the assignment. Following this lecture, the team held a meeting where we decided on lead roles within the group and as well as establishing a universal vision for gameplay and art, making sure we were all on the same page. The team had some ideas about features to add, remove and change, which were discussed. Together with the lead programmer and lead artist, I started working with the team to distribute the work. In the time between talking with the group, I busied myself with rewriting the GDD from scratch, at the request of my co-designer. After lunch the team held another meeting where we brainstormed further, discussed limitations and possibilities, set the scope for the game and worked on a more polished game idea.</p>
								<!-- DAY 2 -->
								<h3>Tuesday</h3>
								<p>I held a meeting first thing in the morning of the second day, where the entire team discussed how their work the previous day had gone, any issues and questions they had encountered, and then what they would work on during the day. Immediately following the meeting, we attended a lecture about source control in Unreal. Again, I got to working on the GDD while not otherwise engaged. After lunch, we held a meeting discussing the art direction of the game. We also successfully got the team up to date with the vision for the gameplay, before coming up with a few new ideas and changes to improve the design. Hari Murali, my co-designer, and myself then discussed the impact of the player's choices in the game and found ourselves unsatisfied with the current iteration of player progression. We developed a new, simple system aimed at giving the player more opportunities to weigh their choices against each other, then electing to sacrifice certain rewards in favor of others. Our hope was that this would make player choices feel more meaningful. After discussing the implementation of this system with the programmers, the team decided to add it to the design. During the meeting we also discussed a system for pick-ups, some potential Easter eggs, and reward rooms. Further, we were informed by the programmers that implementing procedural generation would not be problematic.</p>
