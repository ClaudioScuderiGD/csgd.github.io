								<!-- DAY 1 -->
								<h3>Monday, March 27th</h3>
								<p>The first day of week two, I startd off by researching some unreal capabilities and looking into upcoming updates to the software. 
								I also looked briefly at the requirements of the VR system and how it would apply to the UI implementation. I then spent a little time 
								familiarizing myself with the new UEFN engine and downloading it, before working on moodboards and asset lists for the level. Finally, 
								I spent a few hours in documents explaining the functionality of the UI and the assets it will rely upon.
								</p>

								<p>In order from left to right, and up to down: these pictures depict the moodboards for each room in the middle, 
								upper and lower floors of the house, then progress on the antagonist Greta, progress on the player's van, the player's bag, 
								and some finished environmental props.</p>
								<!-- DAY 2 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Tuesday, March 28th</h3>
								<p>On Tuesday, I started working on a prototype for the settings menu and level information. Both of these menus will be shown in the same 
								diegetic game element. I want to use diegetic UI to increase the immersion, as I believe it is vital for the enjoyability of our game. 
								I combine the two menus into one element for ease of use to the player. This way, they will have fewer objects to keep track of.
								<br><br>
								The game element that they are placed on is going to be a clipboard with a page relating to each of the settings menus. On these pages will 
								be sliders, checkboxes and such which can be interacted with and which will look like pencil markings. The pages will be animated to flip 
								and fold over, contorting and deforming from its original shape, just like a clipboard or book would. Because we are working in VR, 
								the player will be able to see every angle of the clipboard, meaning I have to create a system which keeps every page looking as it should 
								even when the player is't interacting with it. We don't want text on a page to suddenly disappear when the page starts flipping over, as 
								it would likely make players more disconnected from the game. I want to pay attention to such details for this project.
								<br><br>
								I started working within a fresh Unreal Project, trying to get a prototype up and running. I tried a method which relied on the 
								Draw Material to Render Target to update the material on a page (a plane mesh) in accordance with how a menu (a user widget) changed. 
								I wrestled with this method for the duration of the day, learning a lot of useful things but not accomplishing my goal.

								<!-- DAY 3 -->
								<hr>
								<h3>Wednesday, March 29th</h3>
								<p>I kept working on the prototype for our clipboard during the eighth day of the project. For a few hours, I debugged the system I had built 
								the previous day before eventually coming to the realiziation that the method I had been trying would not work for my needs.
								<br><br>
								I would need a UI element (a widget), which are projected on a flat plane, to be placed up against the page while the page is being interacted with.
								A page will be interactable only while it is at the front of the clipboard, at which time it will also be flat. As the page then flips, I need to remove 
								the widget as it would not bend along with the page. This is because a widget placed in game space is on a flat plane. But when the page turns, I need it 
								to keep looking as it did with the widget on it even as the widget is removed. A way of accomplishing this is by capturing a snapshot of the widget's 
								appearance and turning this into a texture. Then, you need simply apply that texture to a dynamic material which you in turn apply to the page's mesh.
								<br><br>
								To accomplish this, I make use of the Scene Capture Component 2D object, basically a camera which feeds whatever it sees into a rendertarget. I can then use 
								the rendertarget's texture to update the page dynamically. I managed to implement this to the point where I can live update a page (plane mesh) to 
								perfectly mirror a widget.
