                    <p>
                        My name is Claudio Scuderi, and I'm a technical game designer studying at PlaygroundSquad in
                        Falun, Sweden.
                        <br><br>
                        Ever since I was a child, I have been very curious and have cultivated many interests.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To list a few of them they ranged from astronomy to technology, from extreme sports to film,
                        books, anime, and mangas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, I have always been immensely attracted to video games and competitions. During my
                        childhood I would watch my two brothers playing on a console all the time, and I still remember
                        vividly the fun I had when I first played.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's how this passion of mine was born, and ever since that moment, I knew I wanted to work
                        with something related to games.
                        <br><br>
                        With that in mind, I decided to study Computer Science at university, and after one year I
                        realized that I was slightly off-target. My main objective was not to script functions to move
                        my character, I wanted to create meaningful experiences and to design the game world and its
                        systems. For this reason, I opted for an education that covered the topics I was more interested
                        in, and that would be Game Design.â€‹
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I studied Game Design for three years at Event Horizon School in Italy and after that, I applied
                        to the Game Design education at PlaygroundSquad in Sweden to have a broader view of the
                        industry. Over the past couple of years, I worked on many game projects both alone and in teams.
                        I enjoyed tackling various challenges and have developed my skills in multiple aspects of game
                        development, amongst which gameplay, level, and system design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, that passion is channelled into my studies and personal projects. I really enjoy the
                        process of learning and exploring
                        all kinds of new concepts in game design. I am driven not only by my curiosity about all aspects
                        of game development, but also by
                        a love for problem-solving that constantly challenges me to grow.
                        My approach to game design involves a hands-on, immersive experience. I spend a significant
                        amount of my time working directly
                        within the engine, implementing, and programming, always with an eye towards the best user
                        experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks to my computer science background, I specialize in the more programming-adjacent
                        technical side of design, mostly as it relates
                        to my favourite side of design, Gameplay design, and I also really enjoy working on systems
                        design as I love competitive games and their balancing always attracted my curiosity.
                        <br><br>
                        As far as teams go, I value collaboration highly. My experience at PlaygroundSquad has shown me
                        the importance of trusting team members and
                        the power of diverse skills in creating quality projects. Recently, I started putting a lot of
                        value in establishing and following a set of
                        best practices, conventions, and workflows for the whole team. This helps tremendously in
                        avoiding confusion, saving time, and elimitating conflicts.
                        Further, I have found that cultivating an environment where making games is fun and exciting for
                        the whole team always shines through to the final product.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of game design, I maintain a balance in life with activities that keep me grounded.
                        Whether it's rising early for a morning run,
                        stretching to maintain flexibility, cooking a new recipe, swimming in lakes, or even taking a
                        cold shower just for the gruelling experience,
                        each activity shapes me, enhancing my life and reflecting back into my work.
                        <br><br>
                        In essence, I am someone who cherishes the process of learning, loves the challenge of
                        problem-solving,
                        and is always excited to bring ideas to life through game design.
                        <br><br>
                        My final goal? To professionally craft accessible and impactful experiences that will leave a
                        mark in the industry and a lasting impression on the player.

                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    This six-week project was all about teamwork. We had an ambitions scope and we needed to work
                    efficiently to get the game
                    where we wanted it in the few weeks we had.
                    My role in this venture saw me wearing many hats, each one challenging yet rewarding in its own
                    unique way.
                    It was a very stressful experence, but it resulted in a project that I feel proud of.
                </p>
                <h4>Game Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The project began with a blank canvas and the excitement of possibility. I was entrusted with the
                    responsibility of designing
                    the game from scratch and writing the Game Design Document (GDD). Though I had final say on our
                    decisions, the team had a lot of
                    interesting and exciting ideas for features, mechanics, animations, guns, and more. Everyone had
                    suggestions and was involved
                    in shaping the game.
                    My co-designer Hari (who was unfortunately absent for much of the project)
                    created most of the rooms used in the level, and I was responsible for the rest of the design work,
                    like designing and balancing the 37 guns that we have in the game. It was a lot of very intense work
                    in many different disciplines,
                    and it
                </p>
                <h4>Project Management</h4>
                <p>
                    In the role of project manager, I found myself in the position of a guiding hand, ensuring the team
                    remained focused and efficient. I was the scrum leader every morning,
                    and I also handled the task of balancing resources, managing timelines, and coordinating efforts
                    with humility and respect for each team member's unique contributions.
                </p>
                <h4>Gameplay Mechanics and User Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    Diving into gameplay mechanics and UI design allowed me to bring some creativity to problem-solving.
                    I helped devise a functioning door system, contributed to an immersive sound system, and designed an
                    intuitive HUD,
                    all of which contributed to the gameplay polish.
                </p>
                <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                <p>
                    Quietly crucial in its role, testing and debugging became an area where I could contribute
                    significantly to the game's polish.
                    Spotting and fixing bugs (and there were a lot), ensuring that our final product was as seamless as
                    possible, was a rewarding,
                    behind-the-scenes role that I was happy to fill.
                </p>
                <h4>Sound Design and Dialogue Writing</h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, my explorations in sound design and dialogue writing were quite the adventure. Curating a
                    collection of sounds and
                    even writing the voice lines for our shopkeeper NPC felt like another step in giving life to our
                    game.
                    Seeing (and hearing!) these elements in the final product was a joyous moment for me.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    All in all, my contributions to the project were wide spanning and focused a lot on both the team
                    and my individual work.
                    I ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for the game, stepping in to help wherever we were
                    struggling in the process.
                    The satisfaction and pride I feel are less about the specific tasks I accomplished, and more about
                    the successful result of
                    our teamwork and the rewarding journey we embarked on together.

                <h2>My Team</h2>
                <p>
                    During this six-week project, I had the privilege of collaborating with the talented group of
                    students making up our team What The
                    Dog Doin' Studios. Their creativity, technical acumen, and commitment to teamwork were key drivers
                    behind the success of
                    our project.
                    <br><br>
                    Each member brought unique skills and perspectives to the table. We faced numerous challenges
                    together,
                    one of the most significant being the integration of our procedural generation system together with
                    hand-made sections.
                    This task turned out to be more complex than we initially anticipated. However, with our collective
                    problem-solving
                    capabilities, we managed to overcome this hurdle and produce our intended result.
                    <br><br>
                    A standout moment of our project was the last day, when our Tick function unexpectedly stopped
                    running. Faced with
                    this (very critical) issue, the team showed impressive resilience and dedication. We pulled
                    together, working tirelessly to not
                    only fix the issue but ensure the overall functionality of the game, resulting in a fully functional
                    product for our
                    deadline the next day.
                    <br><br>
                    Working with such an exceptional team has not only resulted in a successful game project but has
                    also been an
                    enriching experience. It enhanced my understanding of the power of effective collaboration and
                    deepened my appreciation
                    for diverse skill sets.

                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sycle is a turn-based roguelite with a Mesoamerican-like aesthetic and a unique twist, a reverse
                        progression system.
                        In Sycle, the player's journey is marked by growing weaker as they advance. The crux of success
                        lies in Strategic decision-making and resource management.
                        The player assumes the role of Itzel, the Goddess of Change. Her role is to perpetually
                        sacrifice a portion of herself within each cycle to breathe life back
                        into a desolate world.

                        <br><br>
                        Our objective for this project was to carve out a niche in the realm of roguelites, charting a
                        course different from contemporaries.
                        For that, we chose <b>Reverse Progression and Sacrifice as our main pillars</b>, injecting an
                        innovative dynamic where empowerment yields to vulnerability.
                        Additionally, we wanted to push for an aesthetic that was not seen much in the industry, and
                        thanks to one of our team members' background, we discovered
                        how the ancient Mesoamerican cultures like the Aztec and Maya civilizations, seamlessly
                        integrated with the theme of Sacrifice.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the project, I was entrusted with the making of the playerÂ´s abilities. Before
                    starting to design skills that would work well for a
                    strategic turn-based game, I focused on our main character Persona, the goddess Itzel, and what
                    would fit her theme, not only mechanic-wise, but also
                    from a narrative point of view. In doing so I started researching various Mythologies and their
                    related gods, mostly Mesopotamian, Inca, and African
                    until I found all the references I needed. The player had 6 abilities at his disposal (only 4 made
                    it
                    into the game), each with a unique effect and
                    different use case, they are:
                </p>
                <div style="padding-left: 3em;">

                    <h4>Earthquake</h4>
                    <p>
                        The earthquake is an ability that deals damage to enemies and pushes them away from the player,
                        creating a shield of rocks and difficult terrain
                        around Itzel. This skill was inspired by the Earth Mother and fertility goddess of Inca
                        mythology Pachamama, which embodies the mountains and causes
                        earthquakes. Its main use is not only to damage enemies but to gain protection from ranged
                        attacks or secure some time as melee enemies would have to
                        find another path or break the newly created obstacle. The process in mind when designing it was
                        to give the player some kind of survivability as they
                        would be playing as one vs many.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Meteor Fall</h4>
                    <p>
                        The meteor fall is a short-range ability that deals massive damage, burns enemies in a large
                        area, and destroys the obstacles hit.
                        This skill was inspired by Ishtar the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility.
                        This skill is meant to be used against a
                        group of enemies or to open paths that would be inaccessible otherwise. The design for this
                        ability was quite simple, the game required some
                        kind of powerful attack to kill multiple enemies, so I created a short-range explosive spell,
                        that would also modify the environment, as a meteor
                        falling to the ground would definitely have a big effect in the area around it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Tornado</h4>
                    <p>
                        The tornado is an ability that deals low damage and pushes all the enemies around it. This skill
                        was inspired by Hadad the storm and rain god
                        in the ancient Mesopotamian religions. The tornado's main use is to displace enemies into
                        obstacles to damage or kill them. For example, the player
                        could instantly kill a strong enemy by making it fall into a canyon. The process behind this
                        skill was to create something that made the player
                        interact with the environment and use it to its advantage, enabling various playstyles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Holy Smite</h4>
                    <p>
                        The holy smite is a long-range ability that damages enemies and lowers their defense, moreover,
                        it ignores obstacles in its trajectory,
                        as itÂ´s literal lightning falling from the sky. This skill was inspired by Inanna the ancient
                        Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and enforcer
                        of divine justice. This ability was the last one to be made, and while doing so, I realized how
                        the player was missing a long-range attack
                        or in general an action to make when enemies were still far away. For this reason, I opted for a
                        long-range attack that debuffed enemies.
                    </p>
                </div>
                </br>
                <p>
                    After the abilities were done I needed to design various obstacles to fill the game grid with
                    something other than walls and covers and give a reason
                    to the player to interact with the environment. Since my programmers already did the code for
                    damage-over-time effects for the playerÂ´s abilities, I decided
                    to build upon them and add new effects with similar behaviors, so that I could modify them myself. I
                    ended up creating over 10 different obstacles with
                    distinctive effects, pointy walls that would make enemies bleed, columns that could be broken and
                    stun enemies hit by the rubble, terrains that would slow
                    or damage enemies, boulders that could be pushed and knock away enemies and so on.

                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p>
                    While I worked on the playerÂ´s abilities and obstacles, my colleagues designed 3 enemies with
                    different behaviours. As soon as these elements were
                    established in the game I started planning our levels. I was the main level designer for the
                    project. I first studied our main references
                    (XCOM, Warhammer Mechanicus) and tried to understand their process and goals when creating a level.
                    Both of our references included controlling various
                    allies while in our game we played as a single unit, so I had to be mindful of the enemy placement
                    in the level, their range, and movement speed.
                    (Worth noting that after many playtests we decided to add familiars as sub-units to help Itzel in
                    her fight) Now that I knew my constraints,
                    before starting to create mockups for the levels, I decided to write the goals and context that the
                    levels should follow. Some levels focused
                    on teaching certain mechanics to the player; others would focus on pure combat and non-linearity,
                    giving multiple routes to the player, to choose
                    their favourite playstyle; another level would focus on puzzle solving, such as finding and
                    activating all the altars in the level to open the exit
                    door and escape the enemy patrols.

                        <h2>System Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            With the core elements in place, it was time to balance them. As the designer that created
                            most of those elements, I playtested for many hours
                            to discern if those mechanics provided the experience I wanted for our players, and while I
                            was at it, I also created a document for discovered bugs,
                            with a guide on how to replicate them and a possible solution. Moreover, as this was a
                            school project, each week other students would playtest our game,
                            so I prepared a form for them to compile and another document to collect all that valuable
                            feedback. Thanks to the playtest, we realized many issues with
                            the core loop and the balancing of the game. The game went through many changes, for
                            example, at first we used AP (action points) to use our abilities,
                            but we decided to change that resource to HP (health point) to display even better our core
                            pillar <b>Sacrifice</b>. With that update other problems
                            arose, as we would be using our life for each spell thrown at the enemies, so we introduced
                            a healing mechanic when the player killed an enemy with
                            a melee attack. In addition, I tweaked the player and enemiesÂ´ stats until the game reached
                            the desired feel.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project has been an important lesson. It was my and most of the group's first game in Unreal
                    Engine, and we ended up overscoping a bit too much.
                    Even so, we learned a lot, and my contributions to the project were wide-spanning and focused a lot
                    on both the team and my individual work. I had the
                    chance to focus on what I want to specialize in, that being Gameplay and System design. Moreover, I
                    ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for
                    the game, which I did not mind, and step in to help wherever we were struggling in the process. Our
                    scope might have been too big for Sycle, resulting
                    in a small demo rather than the complete game we desired, but it was a fun experience and a good
                    lesson for the future.

                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Wonder Wings takes flight as a vibrant 3D flying shooting game where toys spring to life in
                        whimsical adventure. Players assume control of Mata, a plushie piloting a toy plane, with the
                        mission of thwarting the evil wizard SpellHound and liberating brainwashed toys. The challenge
                        lies in navigating through obstacle-laden environments and engaging in aerial combat without
                        succumbing to enemy fire or crashing the plane.
                        <br><br>
                        With this game, we aimed to address a gap in the market for space shooters, but with a unique
                        twist, transforming spaceships into toys to align with artistic constraints. Embracing a younger
                        target audience, the game features a toony and colorful aesthetic, offering a relaxing yet
                        engaging experience for all players.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I took care of the majority of the gameplay-related mechanics for this project. At the time I was
                    playing the early access version of Everspace 2, so I had an optimal reference for what should have
                    been our space shooter, but as we adapted our concept to our constraints we used toys instead of
                    spaceships. Consequently, the environment went through some changes, it would not be outer space but
                    the inside of a house. For this reason, I also took inspiration from games such as TOY STORY 2: Buzz
                    Lightyear to the Rescue and Airfix Dogfighter, as they were set in a very similar environment.

                    </br>
                    The core loop revolves around exploring rooms within a house, searching for power-ups and secrets,
                    battling malevolent toys, and ultimately facing off against each room's boss.
                </p>

                <h4>Movement</h4>
                <p>
                    Movement was one of our core mechanics, and we wanted it to be intuitive and easy to control, so
                    even a younger audience could play without problems. I started by giving the toy plane a permanent
                    forward movement, so that our players would have only to steer, and worry about the direction rather
                    than the speed of it. After that, I added a rotation mechanic to the plane, using the Q or E keys,
                    would make our plane rotate to the left or the right, with the camera following said rotation,
                    giving the chance to the player to perform stunts to evade enemy projectiles or explore parts of the
                    level too tight to be entered while in a horizontal position.
                    </br>
                    Following I noticed how our collisions were not the best when the player hit a wall, as the plane
                    would slide and tremble on the hit wall. To solve the issue I designed a bouncing mechanic, that
                    bounced back the player's plane in the opposite direction from where they hit the wall, which
                    shortly after, got implemented with its animation.
                    </br>
                    Moreover, after various playtests, I noticed how the automatic forward movement was giving problems
                    to some of our players when they tried to make precise maneuvers, so later on, I decided to add two
                    buttons, one to speed up and one to slow down the movement speed of our plane, giving more control
                    to the players that desired it.
                </p>

                        While designing the movement of our player, I was also keeping in mind our second core mechanic,
                        that being the shooting of our player but also of the game's enemies. For the player, I decided
                        to have two distinct shooting modes, one with low damage but a high rate of fire, like a minigun
                        but in our case it was not shooting bullets but magic particles. The second one was a powerful
                        attack with a low rate of fire, that zoomed our camera in to take aim and shoot a magical
                        rocket. Each shooting type had its projectile speed, reload time, and magazine size.

                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                <p>
                    After the core mechanics were ready, it was time to design how to communicate all those actions to
                    the player. I started with a Health bar in our UI, showing the playerÂ´s health. After that, I added
                    visual cues for player damage such as an animation, and a red outline on the screen, to communicate
                    it as clearly as possible.
                    </br>
                    Successively, I wanted to prevent spam shooting in our game, so I designed an overcharge system that
                    disabled the playerÂ´s shooting if they shot too many bullets in a short amount of time. To convey
                    that without adding an ammo counter, I added another bar, inside the crosshair to be specific, that
                    was slightly filled every time the player shot a bullet, and emptied if they did not shoot for a few
                    seconds.

                </p>
                </br>
                <h4>Replayability</h4>
                <p>
                    The game was supposed to have 5 different rooms for our players to explore, but our vertical slice
                    only had 1 room to show our gameplay. Even so, during playtest we observed how some of our players
                    wanted to compete with each other, trying to complete the level in the fastest way possible.
                    Analyzing that, I decided to add a score system, that gives points to the player on each enemy
                    defeated depending on a multiplier based on playtime. This mechanic, gave a visual way for our
                    players to discover who would have the highest score, moreover, it created retention, improving our
                    replay value, as players would try to improve their score.

                        <h2>Level Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            For this project I worked closely with the art department to create our game level. As we
                            wanted to have a believable space, before
                            creating mockups or blockouts, each member of the team sent a photo of their room as
                            reference. I started analyzing them to see where the furnishings were
                            placed, which were the recurrent items, and how large our environment should be. After
                            having a rough idea, I created the level blockout in engine.
                            As soon as we started playtesting our movement in the scene, we noticed that if the player
                            moved in a straight direction, they would traverse the
                            entirety of the room in less than 10 seconds, and that was an issue.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-section">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I and the rest of the team liked the movement speed of our character, so the only choice was to make
                    the level bigger. I started looking at references of mansionsÂ´ rooms,
                    to then create a new blockout that was 3 times larger when compared to our old level. Then, I
                    divided it into 7 different areas,
                    each offering a unique experience, from safe zones to hidden power-ups and increased enemy
                    encounters. The goal was to provide meaning and pacing in different parts of the room, contributing
                    to an engaging gameplay experience.

                <p>
                    With the core elements in place, I started balancing the stats for the player and the enemies. When
                    we started designing the enemies we wanted them to feel like distinctive units, for this reason, I
                    gave each enemy a unique rate of fire, range, bullet speed, lifetime, and damage. When that was
                    done, I designed how many enemies would spawn during the 2 game waves, what path they would patrol,
                    and then I implemented various spawnpoints for some of them, to have somewhat different runs if the
                    player restarted the game. After that, the game went through many playtest cycles, and I ended up
                    modifying many of the enemiesÂ´ stats to reach the desired game feel. During playtest we also noticed
                    how the majority of the players preferred a risky approach when confronting enemies rather than
                    using their range advantage, resulting in soaking in enemy projectiles, leading to game over. Hence,
                    I introduced a mechanic where enemies had a chance to drop healing orbs, that supported this risky
                    playstyle while also helping beginner players survive longer in the level.
                    </br>
                    Moreover, as the designer in charge of balancing, I playtested the game for many hours and worked
                    closely with my group programmers. Like any game, while playtesting I discovered many bugs, so I
                    created a bug tracking document encompassing how to replicate them, their fix priority, and possible
                    solutions.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this nine-week project, I had the privilege of wearing many hats and contributing to
                    various aspects of our game. Having to step in and help wherever we faced difficulties, I am
                    grateful for the many opportunities to learn and contribute in meaningful ways. Wonder Wings
                    represents a project that I am particularly proud of at this moment in my game design journey, not
                    just for the tasks I accomplished but more so for the successful result of our teamwork and the
                    rewarding journey we navigated together.

                    <p>
                        Nocturnal is a 2D platformer set in a dark and challenging environment. Tasked with overcoming
                        deadly trials, the player navigates the shadows, utilizing three distinct abilities to reach
                        their ultimate goal.
                        <br><br>
                        This was my very first group project, and our team was largely comprised of individuals with
                        limited experience, so we opted for a simple yet impactful concept, a 2D platformer. One of our
                        key constraints was to use only black and white colors for the majority of the game. Throughout
                        the development journey, my primary focus revolved around designing and refining core mechanics,
                        as well as crafting a level with diverse challenges to deliver a gratifying experience to our
                        players.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early stages, the group decided on a 2D platformer with the unique twist of abilities acting
                    as keys to specific challenges. As the person in charge of designing these abilities, knowing we
                    lacked animators for this project, I designed simple mechanics that would not require distinctive
                    animations.
                    </br>
                    The finalized abilities included a double jump, a shrinking ability for tight spaces to evade traps,
                    and a phantom creation feature to unlock doors or locks.
                </p>

                        <h2>Level Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            As my first level design experience, I started by observing references of Trial & Error
                            platformers such as Limbo and Toby the Secret Mine, and I was also slightly inspired by
                            Hollow KnightÂ´s white palace, as I was playing it at the time. After analyzing those games,
                            I created a legend of assets that I would need for our level. Knowing our game would be set
                            in a dark forest, these included spiky vines, swinging trunks, moving platforms, and
                            patrolling enemies. With that ready I started sketching possible platforming challenges that
                            utilized one or a mix of our abilities. When I had a couple dozen of those sketches, I
                            created a mockup of a possible game level and successively whiteboxed it in the engine.

                    As soon as our abilities were ready, the group started to playtest the level, and here I noticed how
                    the majority of the playtesters struggled to surpass some sections. After collecting feedback, I
                    ended up reworking the level, introducing a tutorial for each ability at the start of the game,
                    lowering the difficulty curve in some areas, and making the jump sections more intuitive. more
                    intuitive.

                <p>
                    After the level was ready, I tweaked the playerÂ´s speed and jump height to fit to the game level. I
                    also set the range and timer for the moving platforms, spikes, and trunks.
                    </br>
                    Moreover, in the game's first playtest the level was too hard for the majority of the players. As a
                    solution, I reworked the level, but to prepare for future playtests I also created a beat chart to
                    map the difficulty curve in each section of the level as a graph. This graph would let me know if I
                    would have to rework other obstacles in certain areas or add safe zones to break the pacing of the
                    level and let players relax for a short while.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Nocturnal stands as a significant milestone in my game design journey, marking my initiation into
                    group projects. It was both a rewarding and challenging experience, offering valuable lessons, for example
                    the importance of adapting a concept to fit the needs or constraints of the group, to obtain the best possible result.

                        I love Fire Bending, but I've always been dissapointed with its underwhelming powers compared to
                        the other elements.
                        <br><br>
                        That's why wrote this concept for a new faction for the Avatar: The Last Airbender series. I
                        call them the Thundersong Tribe.

                        I'm tired of the treehugging Druid stereotype. So I created a subclass that embodies the law of
                        the jungle. Only the strong survive.
                        <br><br>
                        Transform into a savage blend of humanoid and beast as you tear through enemies with fangs,
                        claws, spikes, and magic.

                        Spacetram is a tiny infinite runner game I created by myself in a single week.

                        I wanted to try to challenge myself to create a complete game in Unity with limited time and
                        still get all the necessary bits in there.
