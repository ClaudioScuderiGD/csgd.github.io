                    <p>
                        My name is Claudio Scuderi, and I'm a technical game designer studying at PlaygroundSquad in
                        Falun, Sweden.
                        <br><br>
                        Ever since I was a child, I have been very curious and have cultivated many interests.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To list a few of them they ranged from astronomy to technology, from extreme sports to film,
                        books, anime, and mangas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, I have always been immensely attracted to video games and competitions. During my
                        childhood I would watch my two brothers playing on a console all the time, and I still remember
                        vividly the fun I had when I first played.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's how this passion of mine was born, and ever since that moment, I knew I wanted to work
                        with something related to games.
                        <br><br>
                        Today, that passion is channeled into my studies and personal projects. I really enjoy the
                        process of learning and exploring
                        all kinds of new concepts in game design. I am driven not only by my curiosity about all aspects
                        of game development but also by
                        a love for problem-solving that constantly challenges me to grow.
                        My approach to game design involves a hands-on, immersive experience. I spend a significant
                        amount of my time working directly
                        within the engine, implementing, and programming, always with an eye toward the best user
                        experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks to my computer science background, I specialize in the more programming-adjacent
                        technical side of design, mostly as it relates
                        to my favourite side of design, Gameplay design, and I also really enjoy working on systems
                        design as I love competitive games and their balancing always attracted my curiosity.
                        <br><br>
                        As far as teams go, I value collaboration highly. My experience at PlaygroundSquad has shown me
                        the importance of trusting team members and
                        the power of diverse skills in creating quality projects. Recently, I started putting a lot of
                        value in establishing and following a set of
                        best practices, conventions, and workflows for the whole team. This helps tremendously in
                        avoiding confusion, saving time, and elimitating conflicts.
                        Further, I have found that cultivating an environment where making games is fun and exciting for
                        the whole team always shines through to the final product.
                        <br><br>
                        In essence, I am someone who cherishes the process of learning, loves the challenge of
                        problem-solving,
                        and is always excited to bring ideas to life through game design.
                        <br><br>
                        My final goal? To professionally craft accessible and impactful experiences that will leave a
                        mark in the industry and a lasting impression on the player.

                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Priestcore is a fast paced first person arena shooter with a cel-shaded aesthetic, set during
                        the Apocalypse.
                        The player takes the role of Father Gabriel, the priest of Belsit. His role? Defend his
                        cathedral
                        from the incoming waves of demons, exterminate each one of them and survive.
                        <br><br>
                        For this project, the team and I were aware that we would be using an unfamiliar engine called
                        Tengine.
                        Additionally, we had a strict deadline of 6 weeks to deliver a playable and enjoyable game.
                        Given these constraints, I carefully considered which game concept would be most suitable for
                        such a
                        short timeframe. Ultimately, I chose to develop an FPS Arena Shooter, which allowed the artist
                        to save
                        time by focusing on a single environment and eliminating the need for a player character model.

                <h2>Game Design</h2>
                <p>
                    The project began with a blank canvas and the excitement of possibility. I was entrusted with the
                    responsibility of designing the game from scratch and writing the Game Design Document (GDD).
                    Though I had the final say on our decisions, the team had a lot of interesting and exciting ideas
                    for
                    features, mechanics, animations, and more. Everyone had suggestions and was involved in shaping the
                    game.

                <br>
                <h2>Project Management</h2>
                <p>
                    In the role of project manager, I found myself in the position of a guiding hand, ensuring the team
                    remained focused and efficient. I was the scrum leader every morning, and I also handled the task of
                    balancing resources, managing timelines, and coordinating efforts with respect for each team
                    member's unique contributions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project we wanted the player to experience the power and tension that comes from playing a
                    fast-paced shooter,
                    where they always have to be on the move and obliterate an infinite amount of enemies.
                    Our gameplay was very inspired by games like Doom and Ultrakill, we wanted enemy variety, but we
                    ended having only
                    two enemy types for a programming bottleneck as we were developing the game in an almost barebone
                    engine.
                    These enemies were: a small Imp demon that would chase the player and die with a few projectiles,
                    its strenght being in
                    its speed and numbers; and a bigger unit called the Hog, that would shoot the player when they enter
                    its range, but in
                    exchange of its attack range and large quantity of health points, it was a rarer and much slower
                    unit.
                    <br>
                    Moreover, I designed the movement and shooting mechanic of our player. For the movement, the goal
                    was to make the player feel light on their feet
                    while moving around, for that I designed a fast movement speed with a low gravity on the player, and
                    a dash mechanic to dodge
                    enemy projectiles or quickly reposition on the map.
                    <br>
                    Regarding the shooting, we did not have enough time to develop different guns, so I focused on
                    giving the player an automatic
                    weapon with flat damage no matter the distance, as they would be fighting infinite waves of enemies,
                    and I felt that was the
                    best choice to support the fast-pace feeling of our game and have a good playtime, as the player
                    could continuously shoot enemies from far
                    away if they kept moving. If they ever stopped they would get drowned by the amount of incoming
                    enemies.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Before focusing on our game level I expanded the game setting to have a coherent space. Our final
                    setting was very similar to the Castlevania
                    TV series, basically waves of demons were pillaging the Earth and attacking any people or religious
                    building. The player would play as a
                    priest protecting his cathedral and for this reason, the game level resembled a real cathedral. In
                    fact, before working on the actual level,
                    I researched the architecture of many cathedrals (I was lucky enough to have visited many of them in
                    Italy), the key elements that most if
                    not all of them shared, like benches, pillars or the altars, and I also noticed how most of the
                    buildings also shared the same cross shape.
                    After collecting enough info I and the other designer started working on some level mockups. My goal
                    for the level was to have a large space
                    around the pillars for the player to run around, and an altar area where our power-ups would spawn.
                    After completing our mockups, we compared them to see the strong and weak aspects of both, and for
                    the final product we decided to mix our game
                    levels into one to utilize the strenghts of both. For example, I wanted to add some kind of
                    siderooms in my level as it was very rectangular shaped
                    and the experience inside it felt kinda monotonous. To solve this, inspired by my colleague´s level,
                    I added into mine a second floor that
                    drastically improved the gameplay. After that, I noticed how the enemies could block the entrances
                    to the second floor if there were too many,
                    so I changed the pathways to reach it, adding a total of five different routes.
                    Now that I had a level, I needed some kind of obstacles or props to fill the empty space, and
                    knowing that the game was set in an Apocalypse, I
                    talked with our artists to break existing assets in our level, making the level feel affected by the
                    changes in the game world. This resulted in
                    using broken pillars or benches as obstacles.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    All in all, it was a good experience to learn how challenging it can be to work with a new tool such
                    as
                    a different Engine. We had to adapt our game to our constraints and look for creative solutions to
                    obtain
                    good performance and mechanics.
                    I had the opportunity to be the Project Lead and take a lot of responsibility for the game, stepping
                    in to help wherever we were
                    struggling in the process.

                    <p>
                        Sycle is a turn-based roguelite with a Mesoamerican-like aesthetic and a unique twist, a reverse
                        progression system.
                        In Sycle, the player's journey is marked by growing weaker as they advance. The crux of success
                        lies in Strategic decision-making and resource management.
                        The player assumes the role of Itzel, the Goddess of Change. Her role is to perpetually
                        sacrifice a portion of herself within each cycle to breathe life back
                        into a desolate world.

                        <br><br>
                        Our objective for this project was to carve out a niche in the realm of roguelites, charting a
                        course different from contemporaries.
                        For that, we chose <b>Reverse Progression and Sacrifice as our main pillars</b>, injecting an
                        innovative dynamic where empowerment yields to vulnerability.
                        Additionally, we wanted to push for an aesthetic that was not seen much in the industry, and
                        thanks to one of our team members' background, we discovered
                        how the ancient Mesoamerican cultures like the Aztec and Maya civilizations, seamlessly
                        integrated with the theme of Sacrifice.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the project, I was entrusted with the making of the player´s abilities. Before
                    starting to design skills that would work well for a
                    strategic turn-based game, I focused on our main character Persona, the goddess Itzel, and what
                    would fit her theme, not only mechanic-wise, but also
                    from a narrative point of view. In doing so I started researching various Mythologies and their
                    related gods, mostly Mesopotamian, Inca, and African
                    until I found all the references I needed. The player had 6 abilities at their disposal (only 4 made
                    it
                    into the game), each with a unique effect and
                    different use case, they are:
                </p>
                <div style="padding-left: 3em;">

                    <h4>Earthquake</h4>
                    <p>
                        The earthquake is an ability that deals damage to enemies and pushes them away from the player,
                        creating a shield of rocks and difficult terrain
                        around Itzel. This skill was inspired by the Earth Mother and fertility goddess of Inca
                        mythology Pachamama, which embodies the mountains and causes
                        earthquakes. Its main use is not only to damage enemies but to gain protection from ranged
                        attacks or secure some time as melee enemies would have to
                        find another path or break the newly created obstacle. The process in mind when designing this
                        skill was
                        to give the player some kind of survivability as they
                        would be playing as one vs many.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Meteor Fall</h4>
                    <p>
                        The meteor fall is a short-range ability that deals massive damage, burns enemies in a large
                        area, and destroys the obstacles hit.
                        This skill was inspired by Ishtar the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility.
                        This skill is meant to be used against a
                        group of enemies or to open paths that would be inaccessible otherwise. The design for this
                        ability was quite simple, the game required some
                        kind of powerful attack to kill multiple enemies, so I created a short-range explosive spell,
                        that would also modify the environment, as a meteor
                        falling to the ground would definitely have a big effect in the area around it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Tornado</h4>
                    <p>
                        The tornado is an ability that deals low damage and pushes all the enemies around it. This skill
                        was inspired by Hadad the storm and rain god
                        in the ancient Mesopotamian religions. The tornado's main use is to displace enemies into
                        obstacles to damage or kill them. For example, the player
                        could instantly kill a strong enemy by making it fall into a canyon. The process behind this
                        skill was to create something that made the player
                        interact with the environment and use it to its advantage, enabling various playstyles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Holy Smite</h4>
                    <p>
                        The holy smite is a long-range ability that damages enemies and lowers their defense, moreover,
                        it ignores obstacles in its trajectory,
                        as it´s literal lightning falling from the sky. This skill was inspired by Inanna the ancient
                        Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and enforcer
                        of divine justice. This ability was the last one to be made, and while doing so, I realized how
                        the player was missing a long-range attack
                        or in general an action to make when enemies were still far away. For this reason, I opted for a
                        long-range attack that debuffed enemies.
                    </p>
                </div>
                </br>
                <p>
                    After the abilities were done I needed to design various obstacles to fill the game grid with
                    something other than walls and covers and give a reason
                    to the player to interact with the environment. Since my programmers already did the code for
                    damage-over-time effects for the player´s abilities, I decided
                    to build upon them and add new effects with similar behaviors, so that I could modify them myself. I
                    ended up creating over 10 different obstacles with
                    distinctive effects, pointy walls that would make enemies bleed, columns that could be broken and
                    stun enemies hit by the rubble, terrains that would slow
                    or damage enemies, boulders that could be pushed and knock away enemies and so on.

                </p>
                </br>
                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p>
                    While I worked on the player´s abilities and obstacles, my colleagues designed 3 enemies with
                    different behaviours. As soon as these elements were
                    established in the game I started planning our levels. I first studied our main references
                    (XCOM, Warhammer Mechanicus) and tried to understand their process and goals when creating a level.
                    Both of our references included controlling various
                    allies while in our game we played as a single unit, so I had to be mindful of the enemy placement
                    in the level, their range, and movement speed.
                    (Worth noting that after many playtests we decided to add familiars as sub-units to help Itzel in
                    her fight) Now that I knew my constraints,
                    before starting to create mockups for the levels, I decided to write the goals and context that the
                    levels should follow. Some levels focused
                    on teaching certain mechanics to the player; others would focus on pure combat and non-linearity,
                    giving multiple routes to the player, to choose
                    their favourite playstyle; another level would focus on puzzle solving, such as finding and
                    activating all the altars in the level to open the exit
                    door and escape the enemy patrols.

                        <h2>System Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            With the core elements in place, it was time to balance them. As the designer that created
                            most of those elements, I playtested for many hours
                            to discern if those mechanics provided the experience I wanted for our players, and while I
                            was at it, I also created a document for discovered bugs,
                            with a guide on how to replicate them and a possible solution. Moreover, as this was a
                            school project, each week other students would playtest our game,
                            so I prepared a form for them to compile and another document to collect all that valuable
                            feedback. Thanks to the playtest, we realized many issues with
                            the core loop and the balancing of the game. The game went through many changes, for
                            example, at first we used AP (action points) to use our abilities,
                            but we decided to change that resource to HP (health point) to display even better our core
                            pillar <b>Sacrifice</b>. With that update other problems
                            arose, as we would be using our life for each spell thrown at the enemies, so I introduced
                            a healing mechanic when the player killed an enemy with
                            a melee attack. In addition, I tweaked the player and enemies´ stats until the game reached
                            the desired feel.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project has been an important lesson. It was my and most of the group's first game in Unreal
                    Engine, and we ended up overscoping a bit too much.
                    Even so, we learned a lot, and my contributions to the project were wide-spanning and focused a lot
                    on both the team and my individual work. I had the
                    chance to focus on what I want to specialize in, that being Gameplay and System design. Moreover, I
                    ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for
                    the game, which I did not mind, and step in to help wherever we were struggling in the process. Our
                    scope might have been too big for Sycle, resulting
                    in a small demo rather than the complete game we desired, but it was a fun experience and a good
                    lesson for the future.

                    <p>
                        Wonder Wings takes flight as a vibrant 3D flying shooting game where toys spring to life in
                        whimsical adventure. Players assume control of Mata, a plushie piloting a toy plane, with the
                        mission of thwarting the evil wizard SpellHound and liberating brainwashed toys. The challenge
                        lies in navigating through a obstacle-laden environment and engaging in aerial combat without
                        succumbing to enemy fire or crashing the plane.
                        <br><br>
                        With this game, we aimed to address a gap in the market for space shooters, but with a unique
                        twist, transforming spaceships into toys to align with artistic constraints. Embracing a younger
                        target audience, the game features a toony and colorful aesthetic, offering a relaxing yet
                        engaging experience for all players.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I took care of the majority of the gameplay-related mechanics for this project. At the time I was
                    playing the early access version of Everspace 2, so I had an optimal reference for what should have
                    been our space shooter, but as we adapted our concept to our constraints we used toys instead of
                    spaceships. Consequently, the environment went through some changes, it would not be outer space but
                    the inside of a house. For this reason, I also took inspiration from games such as TOY STORY 2: Buzz
                    Lightyear to the Rescue and Airfix Dogfighter, as they were set in a very similar setting.

                    </br>
                    The game core loop revolves around exploring rooms within a house, searching for power-ups and
                    secrets,
                    battling malevolent toys, and ultimately facing off against each room's boss.
                </p>

                <h4>Movement</h4>
                <p>
                    Movement was one of our core mechanics, and we wanted it to be intuitive and easy to control, so
                    even a younger audience could play without problems. I started by giving the toy plane a permanent
                    forward movement, so that our players would have only to steer and worry about the direction rather
                    than their speed. After that, I added a rotation mechanic to the plane, using the Q or E keys,
                    would make our plane rotate to the left or the right, with the camera following said rotation,
                    giving the chance to the player to perform stunts to evade enemy projectiles or explore parts of the
                    level too tight to be entered while in a horizontal position.
                    </br>
                <div style="color: white" class="wonder-show">
                    <img src="images/wonderbouncingGif.gif">

                    Following I noticed how our collisions were not the best when the player hit a wall, as the plane
                    would slide and tremble on the hit wall. To solve the issue I designed a bouncing mechanic, that
                    bounced back the player's plane in the opposite direction from where they hit the wall, which
                    shortly after, got implemented with its animation.
                </div>
                </p>
                <p style="color: white">
                    </br>
                    Moreover, after various playtests, I noticed how the automatic forward movement was giving problems
                    to some of our players when they tried to make precise maneuvers, so later on, I decided to add two
                    buttons, one to speed up and one to slow down the movement speed of our plane, giving more control
                    to the players that desired it.
                </p>

                <h4>Combat</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        While designing the movement of our player, I was also keeping in mind our second core mechanic,
                        that being the shooting of our player but also of the game's enemies. For the player, I decided
                        to have two distinct shooting modes, one with a high rate of fire and a low damage output, and
                        the second
                        one being a powerful attack characterized by a slow rate of fire, that zoomed our camera in to
                        take aim and unleash a magical
                        rocket. Each shooting type had its projectile lifetime, speed, reload time, and magazine size.
                        </br>
                        When the shooting of the player was done, I and another designer, started working on the
                        enemies.
                        We wanted to have a good variety of enemy types and behaviours, so we designed
                        4 different types of enemies, each with its own strenght and weaknesses, and they are:
                    </p>

                                    stationary makes it an easy target, but its health points and powerful melee and
                                    ranged attacks, make up for that weakness.</td>

                                    patrol in a set path. When the player enters their range, they start following them
                                    and shooting sparkly projectiles.The unicorn patrols vary in size, having both small
                                    unicorns with low health points, and bigger mama unicorns that are more resistant to
                                    the player's magic. In addition, the unicorns deal low damage with their attacks but
                                    they have a unique rate of fire, almost like a laser, making them a threatening unit

                                    high-speed beam of light from their trident. They have a slow rate of fire but they
                                    compensate thanks to their projectile speed and damage.</td>

                                    thanks to a rope sustaining them. They also shoot the player as soon as they enter
                                    their range, but their attack is different from the rest. The teru teru bozu shoots
                                    a projectile that expands after a few seconds, forming a massive bubble that damages
                                    everything inside it. In exchange, they have a short range and even though they are
                                    flying, they do not move around, as their rope locks them in place.</td>

                        <p>
                            After the core mechanics were ready, it was time to design how to communicate all those
                            actions to the player. I started with a Health bar for both the player and the enemies,
                            showing their
                            current health.
                            After that, I added visual cues for player damage such as a red outline on the screen, and
                            successively
                            an animation, to communicate it as clearly as possible.
                            </br>
                            Following that, I also wanted to prevent spam shooting in our game, so I designed an
                            overheat
                            system that disabled the player´s shooting if they fired too many bullets in a short amount
                            of time. To
                            convey that without adding an ammo counter, I added a red bar, inside the crosshair to be
                            specific,
                            that was slightly filled every time the player shot a bullet, and emptied if they did not
                            shoot
                            for a few seconds.

                <h4>Replayability</h4>
                <p>
                    The game was supposed to have 5 different rooms for our players to explore, but our vertical slice
                    only had 1 room to show our gameplay. Even so, during playtest we observed how some of our players
                    wanted to compete with each other, trying to complete the level in the fastest way possible.
                    Analyzing that, I decided to add a score system, that gives points to the player on each enemy
                    defeated depending on a multiplier based on playtime. This mechanic, gave a visual way for our
                    players to discover who would have the highest score, moreover, it created retention, improving our
                    replay value, as players would try to improve their score.

                        <h2>Level Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            For this project I worked closely with the art department to create our game level. We
                            wanted to have a believable space, so, before
                            creating mockups or blockouts, each member of the team sent photos of their room as
                            references. I started analyzing them to see where the furnishings were
                            placed, which were the recurrent items, and how large our environment should be. After
                            having a rough idea, I created the level blockout in engine.
                            As soon as we started playtesting our movement in the scene, we noticed that if the player
                            moved in a straight direction, they would traverse the
                            entirety of the room in less than 10 seconds, and that was an issue.

                <p>
                    I and the rest of the team liked the movement speed of our character, so the only choice was to make
                    the level bigger. I started looking at references of mansions´ rooms,
                    to then create a new blockout that was 3 times larger when compared to our old level. Then, I
                    divided the new level into 7 different areas,
                    each offering a somewhat unique experience, from safe zones to environmental mazes hiding power-ups
                    and
                    increased enemy
                    encounters. The goal was to provide meaning and pacing in different parts of the room, contributing
                    to an engaging gameplay experience.
                    </br>
                    Moreover, while placing the enemies in the scene, I set the route of all the moving ones using a
                    point to point movement system,
                    and created various spawn points for them, to have kind of different runs everytime the player

                                worth the risk, as

                <p>
                    With the core elements in place, I started balancing the stats for the player and the enemies. When
                    we started designing the enemies we wanted them to feel like distinctive units, for this reason, I
                    gave each enemy a unique rate of fire, range, bullet speed, lifetime, and damage. When that was
                    done, I designed how many enemies would spawn during the two game waves and what path they would
                    follow.
                    After that, the game went through many playtest cycles, and I ended up
                    modifying many of the enemies´ stats to reach the desired game feel. During playtest we also noticed
                    how the majority of the players preferred a risky approach when confronting enemies rather than
                    using their range advantage, resulting in soaking in enemy projectiles, leading to game over. Hence,
                    I introduced a mechanic where enemies had a chance to drop healing orbs, that supported this risky
                    playstyle while also helping beginner players survive longer in the level.
                    </br>
                    Moreover, as the designer in charge of balancing, I playtested the game for many hours and worked
                    closely with my group programmers. Like any game, while playtesting I discovered many bugs, so I
                    created a bug tracking document encompassing how to replicate them, their fix priority, and possible
                    solutions.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this nine-week project, I had the privilege of wearing many hats and contributing to
                    various aspects of our game. Having to step in and help wherever we faced difficulties, I am
                    grateful for the many opportunities to learn and contribute in meaningful ways. Wonder Wings
                    represents a project that I am particularly proud of at this moment in my game design journey, not
                    just for the tasks I accomplished but more so for the successful result of our teamwork and the
                    rewarding journey we navigated together.

                    <p>
                        Nocturnal is a 2D platformer set in a dark and challenging environment. Tasked with overcoming
                        deadly trials, the player navigates the shadows, utilizing three distinct abilities to reach
                        their ultimate goal.
                        <br><br>
                        This was my very first group project, and our team was largely comprised of individuals with
                        limited experience, so we opted for a simple yet impactful concept, a 2D platformer. One of our
                        key constraints was to use only black and white colors for the majority of the game. Throughout
                        the development journey, my primary focus revolved around designing and refining core mechanics,
                        as well as crafting a level with diverse challenges to deliver a gratifying experience to our
                        players.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early stages, the group decided on a 2D platformer with the unique twist of abilities acting
                    as keys to specific challenges. As the person in charge of designing these abilities, knowing we
                    lacked animators for this project, I designed simple mechanics that would not require distinctive
                    animations.
                    </br>
                    The finalized abilities included a double jump, a shrinking ability for tight spaces to evade traps,
                    and a phantom creation feature to unlock doors.
                </p>
                </br>
                <div class="game-section-container game-section">
                    <div class="half-section">
                        <h2>Level Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            As my first level design experience, I started by observing references of Trial & Error
                            platformers such as Limbo and Toby the Secret Mine, and I was also slightly inspired by
                            Hollow Knight´s white palace, as I was playing it at the time. After analyzing those games,
                            I created a legend of assets that I would need for our level. Knowing our game would be set
                            in a dark forest, these included spiky vines, swinging trunks, moving platforms, and
                            moving snail as our enemies. With that ready I started sketching possible platforming
                            challenges that
                            utilized one or a mix of our abilities. When I had a couple dozen of those sketches, I
                            created a mockup of a possible game level and successively whiteboxed it in the engine.

                <p>
                    As soon as our abilities were ready, the group started to playtest the level, and here I noticed how
                    the majority of the playtesters struggled to surpass some sections. After collecting feedback, I
                    ended up reworking the level, introducing a tutorial for each ability at the start of the game,
                    lowering the difficulty curve in some areas, and making the jump sections more intuitive.

                <h2>System Design</h2>
                <p>
                    After the level was ready, I tweaked the player´s speed and jump height to fit to the game level. I
                    also set the range and timer for the moving platforms, spikes, and trunks.
                    </br>
                    Moreover, as said before, in the game's first playtest the level was too hard for the majority of
                    the players. As a
                    solution, I reworked the level, but to prepare for future playtests I also created a beat chart to
                    map the difficulty curve in each section of the level as a graph. This graph would let me know if I
                    would have to rework other obstacles in certain areas or add safe zones to break the pacing of the
                    level and let players relax for a short while.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nocturnal stands as a significant milestone in my game design journey, marking my initiation into
                    group projects. It was both a rewarding and challenging experience, offering valuable lessons, for
                    example the importance of adapting a concept to fit the needs or constraints of the group, to obtain
                    the
                    best possible result.

                        Spacetram is a tiny infinite runner game I created by myself in a single week.
