                    <p>
                        My name is Claudio Scuderi, and I'm a technical game designer studying at PlaygroundSquad in
                        Falun, Sweden.
                        <br><br>
                        Ever since I was a child, I have been very curious and have cultivated many interests.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To list a few of them they ranged from astronomy to technology, from extreme sports to film,
                        books, anime, and mangas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, I have always been immensely attracted to video games and competitions. During my
                        childhood I would watch my two brothers playing on a console all the time, and I still remember
                        vividly the fun I had when I first played.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's how this passion of mine was born, and ever since that moment, I knew I wanted to work
                        with something related to games.
                        <br><br>
                        With that in mind, I decided to study Computer Science at university, and after one year I
                        realized that I was slightly off-target. My main objective was not to script functions to move
                        my character, I wanted to create meaningful experiences and to design the game world and its
                        systems. For this reason, I opted for an education that covered the topics I was more interested
                        in, and that would be Game Design.​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I studied Game Design for three years at Event Horizon School in Italy and after that, I applied
                        to the Game Design education at PlaygroundSquad in Sweden to have a broader view of the
                        industry. Over the past couple of years, I worked on many game projects both alone and in teams.
                        I enjoyed tackling various challenges and have developed my skills in multiple aspects of game
                        development, amongst which gameplay, level, and system design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, that passion is channelled into my studies and personal projects. I really enjoy the
                        process of learning and exploring
                        all kinds of new concepts in game design. I am driven not only by my curiosity about all aspects
                        of game development, but also by
                        a love for problem-solving that constantly challenges me to grow.
                        My approach to game design involves a hands-on, immersive experience. I spend a significant
                        amount of my time working directly
                        within the engine, implementing, and programming, always with an eye towards the best user
                        experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks to my computer science background, I specialize in the more programming-adjacent
                        technical side of design, mostly as it relates
                        to my favourite side of design, Gameplay design, and I also really enjoy working on systems
                        design as I love competitive games and their balancing always attracted my curiosity.
                        <br><br>
                        As far as teams go, I value collaboration highly. My experience at PlaygroundSquad has shown me
                        the importance of trusting team members and
                        the power of diverse skills in creating quality projects. Recently, I started putting a lot of
                        value in establishing and following a set of
                        best practices, conventions, and workflows for the whole team. This helps tremendously in
                        avoiding confusion, saving time, and elimitating conflicts.
                        Further, I have found that cultivating an environment where making games is fun and exciting for
                        the whole team always shines through to the final product.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of game design, I maintain a balance in life with activities that keep me grounded.
                        Whether it's rising early for a morning run,
                        stretching to maintain flexibility, cooking a new recipe, swimming in lakes, or even taking a
                        cold shower just for the gruelling experience,
                        each activity shapes me, enhancing my life and reflecting back into my work.
                        <br><br>
                        In essence, I am someone who cherishes the process of learning, loves the challenge of
                        problem-solving,
                        and is always excited to bring ideas to life through game design.
                        <br><br>
                        My final goal? To professionally craft accessible and impactful experiences that will leave a
                        mark in the industry and a lasting impression on the player.

                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    This six-week project was all about teamwork. We had an ambitions scope and we needed to work
                    efficiently to get the game
                    where we wanted it in the few weeks we had.
                    My role in this venture saw me wearing many hats, each one challenging yet rewarding in its own
                    unique way.
                    It was a very stressful experence, but it resulted in a project that I feel proud of.
                </p>
                <h4>Game Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The project began with a blank canvas and the excitement of possibility. I was entrusted with the
                    responsibility of designing
                    the game from scratch and writing the Game Design Document (GDD). Though I had final say on our
                    decisions, the team had a lot of
                    interesting and exciting ideas for features, mechanics, animations, guns, and more. Everyone had
                    suggestions and was involved
                    in shaping the game.
                    My co-designer Hari (who was unfortunately absent for much of the project)
                    created most of the rooms used in the level, and I was responsible for the rest of the design work,
                    like designing and balancing the 37 guns that we have in the game. It was a lot of very intense work
                    in many different disciplines,
                    and it
                </p>
                <h4>Project Management</h4>
                <p>
                    In the role of project manager, I found myself in the position of a guiding hand, ensuring the team
                    remained focused and efficient. I was the scrum leader every morning,
                    and I also handled the task of balancing resources, managing timelines, and coordinating efforts
                    with humility and respect for each team member's unique contributions.
                </p>
                <h4>Gameplay Mechanics and User Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    Diving into gameplay mechanics and UI design allowed me to bring some creativity to problem-solving.
                    I helped devise a functioning door system, contributed to an immersive sound system, and designed an
                    intuitive HUD,
                    all of which contributed to the gameplay polish.
                </p>
                <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                <p>
                    Quietly crucial in its role, testing and debugging became an area where I could contribute
                    significantly to the game's polish.
                    Spotting and fixing bugs (and there were a lot), ensuring that our final product was as seamless as
                    possible, was a rewarding,
                    behind-the-scenes role that I was happy to fill.
                </p>
                <h4>Sound Design and Dialogue Writing</h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, my explorations in sound design and dialogue writing were quite the adventure. Curating a
                    collection of sounds and
                    even writing the voice lines for our shopkeeper NPC felt like another step in giving life to our
                    game.
                    Seeing (and hearing!) these elements in the final product was a joyous moment for me.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    All in all, my contributions to the project were wide spanning and focused a lot on both the team
                    and my individual work.
                    I ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for the game, stepping in to help wherever we were
                    struggling in the process.
                    The satisfaction and pride I feel are less about the specific tasks I accomplished, and more about
                    the successful result of
                    our teamwork and the rewarding journey we embarked on together.

                <h2>My Team</h2>
                <p>
                    During this six-week project, I had the privilege of collaborating with the talented group of
                    students making up our team What The
                    Dog Doin' Studios. Their creativity, technical acumen, and commitment to teamwork were key drivers
                    behind the success of
                    our project.
                    <br><br>
                    Each member brought unique skills and perspectives to the table. We faced numerous challenges
                    together,
                    one of the most significant being the integration of our procedural generation system together with
                    hand-made sections.
                    This task turned out to be more complex than we initially anticipated. However, with our collective
                    problem-solving
                    capabilities, we managed to overcome this hurdle and produce our intended result.
                    <br><br>
                    A standout moment of our project was the last day, when our Tick function unexpectedly stopped
                    running. Faced with
                    this (very critical) issue, the team showed impressive resilience and dedication. We pulled
                    together, working tirelessly to not
                    only fix the issue but ensure the overall functionality of the game, resulting in a fully functional
                    product for our
                    deadline the next day.
                    <br><br>
                    Working with such an exceptional team has not only resulted in a successful game project but has
                    also been an
                    enriching experience. It enhanced my understanding of the power of effective collaboration and
                    deepened my appreciation
                    for diverse skill sets.

                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sycle is a turn-based roguelite with a Mesoamerican-like aesthetic and a reverse progression
                        system, meaning that the more
                        the player advances in the game the weaker they become. Strategic choices and resource
                        management are fundamental to be
                        successful in this game.
                        The protagonist is Itzel the Goddess of Change and her role is to sacrifice part of herself in
                        each cycle to restore the
                        world back to life.
                        <br><br>
                        Our goal for this project was to produce a game that was different compared to all the
                        roguelites that came out at the time.
                        For that, we chose <b>Reverse Progression and Sacrifice as our main pillars</b>, the player
                        would grow weaker instead of more powerful as time passed.
                        We also wanted to push for an aesthetic that was not seen much in the industry, and thanks to
                        one of our team members background,
                        we discovered how the ancient Mesoamerican cultures like Aztec and Maya fitted perfectly the
                        concept of Sacrifice.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the project, I was entrusted with the making of the player´s abilities. Before
                    starting to design skills that would work well for a strategic
                    turn-based game, I focused on our main character Persona, the goddess Itzel, and what would fit her
                    theme, not only mechanic-wise, but also from a narrative point
                    of view. In doing so I started researching various Mythologies and their related gods, mostly
                    Mesopotamian, Inca, and African until I found all the references
                    I needed. The player had 6 abilities at his disposal(only 4 made it into the game), each with a
                    unique effect and different use case, they are:
                </p>
                <div style="padding-left: 3em;">

                    <h4>Earthquake</h4>
                    <p>
                        The earthquake is an ability that deals damage to enemies and pushes them away from the player,
                        creating a shield of rocks and difficult terrain around Itzel. This skill was
                        inspired by the Earth Mother and fertility goddess of Inca mythology Pachamama, which embodies
                        the mountains and causes earthquakes. Its main use is not
                        only to damage enemies but to gain protection from ranged attacks or secure some time as melee
                        enemies would have to find another path or break the
                        newly created obstacle. The process in mind when designing it was to give the player some kind
                        of survivability as they would be playing as one vs many.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Meteor Fall</h4>
                    <p>
                        The meteor fall is a short-range ability that deals massive damage, burns enemies in a large
                        area, and destroys the obstacles hit. This skill was inspired by Ishtar
                        the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility. This skill is meant to be used
                        against a group of enemies or to open paths that would be
                        inaccessible otherwise. The design for this ability was quite simple, the game required some
                        kind of powerful attack to kill multiple enemies, so I created
                        a short-range explosive spell, that would also modify the environment, as a meteor falling to
                        the ground would have a big effect in the area around it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Tornado</h4>
                    <p>
                        The tornado is an ability that deals low damage and pushes all the enemies around it. This skill
                        was inspired by Hadad the storm and rain god in the ancient
                        Mesopotamian religions. The tornado´s main use is to displace enemies into obstacles to damage or
                        kill them. For example, the player could instantly kill
                        a strong enemy by making it fall into a canyon. The process behind this skill was to create
                        something that made the player interact with the environment and use it to its advantage, enabling various playstyles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Holy Smite</h4>
                    <p>
                        The holy smite is a long-range ability that damages enemies and lowers their defense, moreover, it
                        ignores obstacles in its trajectory, as it´s literal lightning falling from the sky. This 
                        skill was inspired by Inanna the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and enforcer of 
                        divine justice. This ability was the last one to be made, and while doing so, I realized how the
                        player was missing a long-range attack or in general an action to make when enemies were still far away.
                        For this reason, I opted for a long-range spell that debuffed enemies.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </br>
            <p>
                After the abilities were done I needed to design various obstacles to fill the game grid with something other than walls and covers
                and give a reason to the player to interact with the environment. Since my programmers already did the code for damage-over-time effects for the player´s abilities,
                 I decided to build upon them and add new effects with similar behaviours, so that I could modify them myself.
                 I ended up creating over 10 different obstacles with distinctive effects, pointy walls that would make enemies bleed, columns that could be 
                 broken and stun enemies hit by the rubble, terrains that would slow or damage enemies, boulders that could be pushed and knock away enemies and so on.
            </p>
        </br>
                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p>
                    While I worked on the player´s abilities and obstacles, my colleagues had designed 3 enemies with different
                    behaviours, and as soon as these elements were established in the game I started planning our levels.
                    I was the main level designer for the project. The first thing I did was to study our main
                    references(XCOM, Warhammer Mechanicus) and try to understand their process and goals when creating a level.
                    Both of our references included controlling various allies while in our game we played as a single unit, so I had
                    to be mindful of the enemy placement in the level, their range, and movement speed. (Worth noting that after many 
                    playtests we decided to add familiars as sub-units to help Itzel in her fight) Now that I knew my constraints, 
                    before starting to create mockups for the levels, I decided to write the goals and context that the levels should follow.
                    Some levels focused on teaching certain mechanics to the player; others would focus on pure combat and non-linearity, giving multiple routes to the player, 
                    to choose their favourite playstyle; another level would focus on puzzle solving, such as finding and activating all the altars in the level to
                    open the exit door and escape the enemy patrols.

                <h2>System Design</h2>
                <p>
                    After working on the abilities, levels, and obstacles, it was time to balance them. As the designer that created most of those elements,
                    I playtested for many hours to discern if those mechanics provided the experience I wanted for our players, and while I was at it, I also
                    created a document for discovered bugs, with a guide on how to replicate them and a possible solution. Moreover, as this was a 
                    school project, each week other students would playtest our game, so I prepared a form for them to compile and another document to collect all that
                    valuable feedback.
                    Thanks to the playtest, we realized many issues with the core loop and the balancing of the game. The game went through many changes,
                    for example at first we used AP(action points) to use our abilities, but we decided to change that resource in HP(health point) to display even
                    better our core pillar <b>Sacrifice</b>. With that update other problems arose, as we would be using our life for each spell thrown at the enemies,
                    so we introduced a healing mechanic when the player killed an enemy with a melee attack. In addition, I tweaked the player and enemies´ max HP and
                    attack damage until the game reached the desired feel.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project has been an important lesson. It was my and most of the group's first game in Unreal Engine, and we ended overscoping a bit too much.
                    Even so, we learned a lot, and my contributions to the project were wide-spanning and focused a lot on both the team and my individual work.
                    I had the chance to focus on what I want to specialize in, that being Gameplay and System design.
                    Moreover, I ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for the game, which I did not mind, and step in to help wherever we were
                    struggling in the process.
                    Our scope might have been too big for Sycle, resulting in a small demo rather than the complete game we desired, but it was a fun experience 
                    and a good lesson for the future.

                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Wonder Wings is a 3D flying shooting game where toys takes life and start moving around. The player controls Mata a plushie piloting a toy plane. Her goal? 
                         Defeat the evil wizard SpellHound and all the brainwashed toys that follow him, without crashing her plane into obstacles or falling under enemy fire.
                        <br><br>
                        With this game, we wanted to fill a hole in the market left by the absence of space shooters at the time, but instead of spaceships
                         we ended using toys for artistic constraints. Knowing our new target audience, we pushed for a toony and colorful aesthetic and a 
                         relaxing experience that everyone could enjoy.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I took care of the majority of the gameplay related mechanics for this project. At the time I was playing the early access version of Everspace 2, so I had an optimal reference for what should have been our space shooter,
                     but as we adapted our concept to our constraints we used toys instead of spaceships. Consequently the environment went through some changes, it would not be outer space but the inside of a house. For this reason I also 
                     took inspiration by games such as TOY STORY 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue and Airfix Dogfighter, as they were set in a very similar environment.
                    </br>
                    The game core loop would see the player flying around various rooms of a pretty big house (only 1 room in the game demo), exploring it for power-ups and secrets, shooting at the evil toys that make our game enemies, and finally
                    defeating the room's boss to then go through another house's room. All accompanied by a colorful and light hearted aesthetic and bright visual effects.
                </p>

                <h4>Movement</h4>
                <p>
                   Movement was one of our core mechanics, and we wanted for it to be intuitive and easy to control, so even a younger audience could play without problems.
                   I started by giving the toy plane a permanent forward movement, so that our players would have only to steer, and worry about the direction rather than the speed of it.
                   After that, I added a rotation mechanic to the plane, using the Q or E keys, would make our plane rotate to the left or the right, with the camera following said rotation,
                   giving the chance to the player to perform stunts to evade enemy projectiles or explore parts of the level too tight to be entered while in a horizontal position.
                </br>
                   Following I noticed how our collision were not the best when the player hit a wall, as the plane would slide and (tremble? tipo che si bugga) on the hit wall. To solve the
                   issue I designed a bouncing mechanic, that bounced back the player's plane in the opposite direction from where they hit the wall, that shortly after, got implemented with its animation.
                </br>
                   Moreover, after various playtest, I noticed how the automatic forward movement was giving problems to some of our players, when they tried to make precise maneuvers, so later on
                   I decided to add two buttons, one to speed up and one to slow down the movement of our plane, giving more control to the players that desired it.
                </p>

                <h4>Combat</h4>

                        <p>
                            While designing the movement of our player, I was also keeping in mind our second core mechanic, that being the shooting of our player but also of the game's enemies.
                            For the player I decided to have two types of shooting, one with low damage but high rate of fire, like a minigun but in our case it was not shooting bullets but magic particles;
                            and the second one being a powerful attack with a low rate of fire, that zoomed our camera in to take aim and shoot a magical rocket. Each shooting type had its own projectile speed, 
                            reload time and magazine size.
                        </br>
                            When the shooting of the player was done, I and another designer, started working on the enemies. We wanted to have a good variety of enemy types and behaviours, so we designed
                            4 different types of enemies, each with its own strenght and weaknesses, and they are:

                                        The unicorns patrols vary in size, having both small unicorns with low health points, and bigger mama unicorns that are more resistant to the player's magic. 
                                        In addition, the unicors deals low damage
                                        with their attacks but they have a unique rate of fire, almost like a laser, making them a threatning unit if not left alone.</td>

                    <h4>Feedback</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the core mechanics were ready, it was time to design how to communicate all those actions to the player.
                        I started with a standard Health bar in our UI, showing the player´s current health. After that, we added an animation
                        for when the player gets hit, and a red outline on the screen, to communicate it as clearly as possible.
                    </br>
                        Successively, I wanted to prevent spam shooting in our game, so I designed a overcharge system that disabled the player´s shooting if they shot too
                        many bullets in a short amount of time. To convey that without adding an ammo counter, I added another bar, inside the crosshair to be specific,
                        that was slightly filled every time the player shot a bullet, and emptyed if they did not shoot for a few seconds.
                        
                    </p>
                </br>
                    <h4>Replayability</h4>
                    <p>
                        The game was supposed to have 5 different rooms for our player to explore, but our vertical slice only had 1 room
                        to show our gameplay. Even so, during playtest we observed how some of our players wanted to compete with each other, trying to 
                        complete the level in the fastest way possible. Analyzing that, I decided to add a score system, that gives points to the player on
                        each enemy defeated depending on a multiplier based on playtime. This mechanic, gave a visual way to our player to discover who would 
                        have the highest score, moreover, it created retention, improving our replayability, as players would try to improve their score.

                    <h2>Level Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project I worked closely with the art department to create our game level. As we wanted to have a believable space, before
                        creating mockups or blockouts, each member of the team sent a photo of their room as reference. I started analyzing them to see where the furnishings were
                        placed, which were the recurrent items, and how large our environment should be. After having a rough idea, I created the level blockout in engine.
                        As soon as we started playtesting our movement in the scene, we noticed that if the player moved in a straight direction, they would traverse the 
                        entirety of the room in less than 10 seconds, and that was an issue.

                        I and the rest of the team liked the movement speed of our character, so the only choice was to make the level bigger. I started looking at references of mansions´ rooms,
                        to then create a new blockout that was 3 times larger when compared to our old level. Then, I divided it into 7 different areas,
                        each having something that differentiate it from the others. Some areas would be safe zones, some would contain hidden power-ups, others would have more 
                        enemies. In doing so I tried to give meaning to each part of the room and have a different pacing depending on where the player would fly.

                    <h2>System Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the core elements in place, I started balancing the stats for the player and the enemies.
                        When we started designing the enemies we wanted for them to feel like distinctive units, for this reason
                        I gave each enemy a unique rate of fire, range, bullet speed, lifetime and damage.
                        When that was done, I designed how many enemies would spawn during the 2 game waves, what path they would patrol, and then I implemented various
                        spawnpoints for some of them, to have somewhat different runs if the player restarted the game.
                        After that, the game went through many playtest cycles, and I ended modifying many of the enemies´ stats to reach the desired game feel.
                        During playtest we also noticed how the majority of the players preferred a risky approach when confronting enemies rather than using their range
                        advantage, resulting in soaking in enemy projectiles, leading to game over. Hence, I introduced a mechanic where enemies had a chance to drop
                        healing orbs, that supported this risky playstyle while also helping beginner players survive longer in the level.
                    </br>
                        Moreover, as the designer in charge of balancing, I playtested the game for many hours, and worked closely with my group programmers.
                        Like any game, while playtesting I discovered many bugs, so I created a bug tracking document encompassing how to replicate them, 
                        their fix priority, and possible solutions.                       
                    </p>
                </br>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this nine-week project, I had the privilege of wearing many hats and contributing to
                        various aspects of our game. Having to step in and help wherever we faced difficulties,
                        I am grateful for the many opportunities to learn and contribute in meaningful ways.
                        Wonder Wings is the game that I am most proud at the moment not just for the tasks I accomplished 
                        but more so for the successful result of our teamwork and the rewarding journey we navigated together.

                    <p>
                        Edge of Divinity is an intense top-down 2D slasher where players must maintain their momentum to
                        exceed.
                        The game puts players in control of a character armed with a sword, with the core mechanic
                        focusing on
                        precise sword swinging to damage enemies. The amount of damage inflicted by the sword is
                        determined by
                        the velocity and momentum of the swing, creating a satisfying and skill-based gameplay
                        experience.
                        <br><br>
                        During the whole process of creating this game, my focus has been on refining the core mechanic,
                        that of
                        momentum-based swordplay. My goal was to make it look, feel and behave just how I wanted it, to
                        make sure
                        that the foundation was incredibly solid. I am very pleased with what I have thus far been able
                        to put together!

                <h2>An ongoing project</h2>
                <h4>Concept</h4>
                <p>
                    Edge of Divinity is an intense top-down 2D game where players must maintain their momentum to
                    exceed. The game puts players in control of a character armed with a sword, with the core mechanic
                    focusing on precise sword swinging to damage enemies. The amount of damage inflicted by the sword is
                    determined by the velocity and momentum of the swing, creating a satisfying and skill-based gameplay
                    experience.
                </p>
                <h4>My Plan</h4>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, I wanted to put my time into making the main mechanic behave and feel the way I
                    wanted it to. I expected the biggest challenge in this would be making the momentum change feel
                    impactful and satisfying to the player, which turned out to be correct. Once I was satisfied with
                    the feel of core mechanics, I would look into adding more content where I felt it would improve the
                    experience.
                </p>
                <h4>Thought Process</h4>
                <p>
                    My core philosophy throughout the project has been trying to minimize the complexity of the game
                    whilst maximizing the skill ceiling and skill expression. I want the gist of the gameplay to be
                    easily understood within your first minute of playing, but I want your tenth hour of playing to
                    still feel satisfying and captivating.
                    <br><br>
                    The main mechanic of the game is a somewhat novel mouse-based movement system which I have found to
                    be quickly understood even by uninitiated players. It’s simple enough to pick up on the fly and
                    understand, and reliable enough to perform how the player expects it to. The nature of the game
                    itself, putting a lot of emphasis on momentum, makes gameplay fast-paced and requires the player to
                    act on split-second decisions to perform optimally.
                    <br><br>
                    The playtesters I’ve been lucky enough to have aiding me through this process have given me a lot of
                    suggestions for additions to the game. “What if you could keep a combo up even after a dash by using
                    the Pivot ability”, “You should make slashing enemy bullets should also activate the lunge”,
                    “Couldn’t the walls bounce you back when you dash into them?”, etc. I have carefully considered
                    these suggestions but ultimately only implemented a select few of them.
                    <br><br>
                    I considered things such as <span class="highlight">consistency</span>: making sure that the game
                    behaves how the player expects it to, <span class="highlight">encouraging playmaking</span>: being
                    careful to reward specifically non-stale play, which keeps the game exciting, and <span
                        class="highlight">quality of life</span>: trying to keep a smooth and satisfying experience for
                    the player.
                    <br><br>
                    Returning to a previous example, let’s say that slashing enemy projectiles gave the same effect as
                    slashing an enemy (the ability to lunge). This change might be <span
                        class="highlight">consistent</span> with the notion that slashing things activates the lunge,
                    <span class="underscore">but</span> it would also be <span class="highlight">encouraging</span> the
                    player to keep projectile enemies alive, as doing so would result in greater manoeuvrability and
                    speed, both of which are highly desirable.
                    <br>
                    I decided that I did not want keeping enemies alive to be the most effective way to play the game,
                    and so I made the decision not to include this particular change.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the playtesting, a lot of players expressed that the game felt highly satisfying… until you
                    missed a strike. Doing so left you barreling toward who-knows-where, unable to do anything to
                    rectify the unfortunate situation. While the goal of the game is of course not to make the player
                    feel <span class="underscore">unsatisfied</span>, I was also struggling to find a good solution for
                    this. If messing up had no consequence, good play would feel less rewarding as a result. This is
                    where the suggestion of bouncy walls surrounding the arena presented a <span class="highlight">great
                        quality of life</span> improvement. Though this is not <span class="highlight">consistent</span>
                    with the other walls, giving these specific walls a different look let players know that there was
                    something special about them. I didn’t want to <span class="highlight">encourage</span> the player
                    to go for hail marys across the stage, so I made you lose 20% of your speed when you bounce.
                </p>
                <h4>Priorities of my first four weeks</h4>
                <p>
                    Just as I had planned to do, I put the bulk of my effort into the main mechanic of the game: dashing
                    and slashing. My biggest priority throughout the project was, and is, to make sure that this feels
                    responsive and satisfying to the player. For this reason, I have also put some time into making VFX
                    to support the look and feel of the bladework. Adding these VFX made the game look and feel more
                    fluid and also helped with readability, making for a sizable improvement.
                    <br><br>
                    My reasoning behind this is simple. I feel that a solid core mechanic allows the game to remain
                    uncomplicated and elegant in it’s design while still having intricacy and depth for the player to
                    improve and grow in. It also gives me a very solid base to expand on the game from, should I wish
                    to. I could make any number of gamemodes for this specific game later on.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, I was not able to create a complete game in the timeframe. I am, however, very happy
                    with the proof of concept I have made, and would say that the game is currently in a sort of “beta”
                    state. Though it does not have all the polish I would have hoped, it is fully functional, and I am
                    very happy with the state of the slash- and dash mechanic.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to skip on creating things like an options menu, background music, art and such “fluff” as
                    I like to call it. While the fluff is absolutely a relevant (and indeed quite important) factor for
                    finished games, I was not willing to skimp on the core mechanics of the game to prioritize such
                    aspects within these four weeks. I had plans to implement temporary sound effects, enemy models,
                    environments for everything that would benefit from it, as well as plans to make a more appealing
                    HUD and menus, but never found the time. Rather, I focused on the core of the game.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project, I have made deliberate design choices to ensure that the core mechanics
                    shine, even at the expense of adding "fluff" elements such as background music or extensive visual
                    assets. While these aspects were not prioritized within the project's scope, they remain
                    opportunities for future development and polish.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking ahead, I see immense potential for expanding 'Edge of Divinity' into a more complete and
                    fully realized game. The foundation I have established provides a solid base for adding additional
                    content, such as new game modes, enemy types, and environments, that could further enhance the
                    gameplay experience.
                    <br><br>
                    'Edge of Divinity' stands as a proof of concept, a testament to the joy of precise swordplay, and a
                    stepping stone towards the realization of a fully-fledged game that captures the essence of becoming
                    a godlike force of tranquil destruction.

                    The faster you swing, the more damage
                    your slashes deal. Increasing your character's
                    speed also increases this damage!

                    When a glowing white circle appears at your
                    feet, you can activate a
                    <span class="highlight">"Lunge"</span>.
                    When you stand still,
                    <span class="highlight">Lunging</span>
                    sends you flying forwards with a burst of speed.
                    After a short while, you will start
                    slowing down unless you hit a new target.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Successfully slashing a target creates a
                    slowly closing white circle at your feet,
                    indicating that you can perform a
                    <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>
                    as long as the circle persists.
                    Activating the
                    <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>
                    gives you a speed boost and sends you
                    flying toward the direction of your sword.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You also have the ability
                    <span class="highlight">Pivot</span>, which is
                    a way to "fake" a hit (that means it activates your
                    <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>!).

                <p>
                    You are able to slash several targets with a single swing.
                    Whenever you hit a second target before the prior
                    one's white <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>
                    circle dissapears, your
                    <span class="highlight">Combo</span> counter increases.
                    <span class="highlight">Lunging</span> while you have an
                    active <span class="highlight">Combo</span> will end it -
                    and grant you a significant speed boost increasing with
                    the number of hits in the
                    <span class="highlight">Combo</span>.

                        I love Fire Bending, but I've always been dissapointed with its underwhelming powers compared to
                        the other elements.
                        <br><br>
                        That's why wrote this concept for a new faction for the Avatar: The Last Airbender series. I
                        call them the Thundersong Tribe.
