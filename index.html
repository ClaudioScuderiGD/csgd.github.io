                    <p>
                        My name is Claudio Scuderi, and I'm a technical game designer studying at PlaygroundSquad in
                        Falun, Sweden.
                        <br><br>
                        Ever since I was a child, I have been very curious and have cultivated many interests.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To list a few of them they ranged from astronomy to technology, from extreme sports to film,
                        books, anime, and mangas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, I have always been immensely attracted to video games and competitions. During my
                        childhood I would watch my two brothers playing on a console all the time, and I still remember
                        vividly the fun I had when I first played.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's how this passion of mine was born, and ever since that moment, I knew I wanted to work
                        with something related to games.
                        <br><br>
                        With that in mind, I decided to study Computer Science at university, and after one year I
                        realized that I was slightly off-target. My main objective was not to script functions to move
                        my character, I wanted to create meaningful experiences and to design the game world and its
                        systems. For this reason, I opted for an education that covered the topics I was more interested
                        in, and that would be Game Design.​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I studied Game Design for three years at Event Horizon School in Italy and after that, I applied
                        to the Game Design education at PlaygroundSquad in Sweden to have a broader view of the
                        industry. Over the past couple of years, I worked on many game projects both alone and in teams.
                        I enjoyed tackling various challenges and have developed my skills in multiple aspects of game
                        development, amongst which gameplay, level, and system design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, that passion is channelled into my studies and personal projects. I really enjoy the
                        process of learning and exploring
                        all kinds of new concepts in game design. I am driven not only by my curiosity about all aspects
                        of game development, but also by
                        a love for problem-solving that constantly challenges me to grow.
                        My approach to game design involves a hands-on, immersive experience. I spend a significant
                        amount of my time working directly
                        within the engine, implementing, and programming, always with an eye towards the best user
                        experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks to my computer science background, I specialize in the more programming-adjacent
                        technical side of design, mostly as it relates
                        to my favourite side of design, Gameplay design, and I also really enjoy working on systems
                        design as I love competitive games and their balancing always attracted my curiosity.
                        <br><br>
                        As far as teams go, I value collaboration highly. My experience at PlaygroundSquad has shown me
                        the importance of trusting team members and
                        the power of diverse skills in creating quality projects. Recently, I started putting a lot of
                        value in establishing and following a set of
                        best practices, conventions, and workflows for the whole team. This helps tremendously in
                        avoiding confusion, saving time, and elimitating conflicts.
                        Further, I have found that cultivating an environment where making games is fun and exciting for
                        the whole team always shines through to the final product.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of game design, I maintain a balance in life with activities that keep me grounded.
                        Whether it's rising early for a morning run,
                        stretching to maintain flexibility, cooking a new recipe, swimming in lakes, or even taking a
                        cold shower just for the gruelling experience,
                        each activity shapes me, enhancing my life and reflecting back into my work.
                        <br><br>
                        In essence, I am someone who cherishes the process of learning, loves the challenge of
                        problem-solving,
                        and is always excited to bring ideas to life through game design.
                        <br><br>
                        My final goal? To professionally craft accessible and impactful experiences that will leave a
                        mark in the industry and a lasting impression on the player.

                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    This six-week project was all about teamwork. We had an ambitions scope and we needed to work
                    efficiently to get the game
                    where we wanted it in the few weeks we had.
                    My role in this venture saw me wearing many hats, each one challenging yet rewarding in its own
                    unique way.
                    It was a very stressful experence, but it resulted in a project that I feel proud of.
                </p>
                <h4>Game Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The project began with a blank canvas and the excitement of possibility. I was entrusted with the
                    responsibility of designing
                    the game from scratch and writing the Game Design Document (GDD). Though I had final say on our
                    decisions, the team had a lot of
                    interesting and exciting ideas for features, mechanics, animations, guns, and more. Everyone had
                    suggestions and was involved
                    in shaping the game.
                    My co-designer Hari (who was unfortunately absent for much of the project)
                    created most of the rooms used in the level, and I was responsible for the rest of the design work,
                    like designing and balancing the 37 guns that we have in the game. It was a lot of very intense work
                    in many different disciplines,
                    and it
                </p>
                <h4>Project Management</h4>
                <p>
                    In the role of project manager, I found myself in the position of a guiding hand, ensuring the team
                    remained focused and efficient. I was the scrum leader every morning,
                    and I also handled the task of balancing resources, managing timelines, and coordinating efforts
                    with humility and respect for each team member's unique contributions.
                </p>
                <h4>Gameplay Mechanics and User Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    Diving into gameplay mechanics and UI design allowed me to bring some creativity to problem-solving.
                    I helped devise a functioning door system, contributed to an immersive sound system, and designed an
                    intuitive HUD,
                    all of which contributed to the gameplay polish.
                </p>
                <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                <p>
                    Quietly crucial in its role, testing and debugging became an area where I could contribute
                    significantly to the game's polish.
                    Spotting and fixing bugs (and there were a lot), ensuring that our final product was as seamless as
                    possible, was a rewarding,
                    behind-the-scenes role that I was happy to fill.
                </p>
                <h4>Sound Design and Dialogue Writing</h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, my explorations in sound design and dialogue writing were quite the adventure. Curating a
                    collection of sounds and
                    even writing the voice lines for our shopkeeper NPC felt like another step in giving life to our
                    game.
                    Seeing (and hearing!) these elements in the final product was a joyous moment for me.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    All in all, my contributions to the project were wide spanning and focused a lot on both the team
                    and my individual work.
                    I ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for the game, stepping in to help wherever we were
                    struggling in the process.
                    The satisfaction and pride I feel are less about the specific tasks I accomplished, and more about
                    the successful result of
                    our teamwork and the rewarding journey we embarked on together.

                <h2>My Team</h2>
                <p>
                    During this six-week project, I had the privilege of collaborating with the talented group of
                    students making up our team What The
                    Dog Doin' Studios. Their creativity, technical acumen, and commitment to teamwork were key drivers
                    behind the success of
                    our project.
                    <br><br>
                    Each member brought unique skills and perspectives to the table. We faced numerous challenges
                    together,
                    one of the most significant being the integration of our procedural generation system together with
                    hand-made sections.
                    This task turned out to be more complex than we initially anticipated. However, with our collective
                    problem-solving
                    capabilities, we managed to overcome this hurdle and produce our intended result.
                    <br><br>
                    A standout moment of our project was the last day, when our Tick function unexpectedly stopped
                    running. Faced with
                    this (very critical) issue, the team showed impressive resilience and dedication. We pulled
                    together, working tirelessly to not
                    only fix the issue but ensure the overall functionality of the game, resulting in a fully functional
                    product for our
                    deadline the next day.
                    <br><br>
                    Working with such an exceptional team has not only resulted in a successful game project but has
                    also been an
                    enriching experience. It enhanced my understanding of the power of effective collaboration and
                    deepened my appreciation
                    for diverse skill sets.

                <div class="half-section">
                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sycle is a turn-based roguelite with a Mesoamerican-like aesthetic and a reverse progression
                        system, meaning that the more
                        the player advances in the game the weaker they become. Strategic choices and resource
                        management are fundamental to be
                        successful in this game.
                        The protagonist is Itzel the Goddess of Change and her role is to sacrifice part of herself in
                        each cycle to restore the
                        world back to life.
                        <br><br>
                        Our goal for this project was to produce a game that was different compared to all the
                        roguelites that came out at the time.
                        For that, we chose <b>Reverse Progression and Sacrifice as our main pillars</b>, the player
                        would grow weaker instead of more powerful as time passed.
                        We also wanted to push for an aesthetic that was not seen much in the industry, and thanks to
                        one of our team members background,
                        we discovered how the ancient Mesoamerican cultures like Aztec and Maya fitted perfectly the
                        concept of Sacrifice.

                <h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the project, I was entrusted with the making of the player´s abilities. Before
                    starting to design skills that would work well for a strategic
                    turn-based game, I focused on our main character Persona, the goddess Itzel, and what would fit her
                    theme, not only mechanic-wise, but also from a narrative point
                    of view. In doing so I started researching various Mythologies and their related gods, mostly
                    Mesopotamian, Inca, and African until I found all the references
                    I needed. The player had 6 abilities at his disposal(only 4 made it into the game), each with a
                    unique effect and different use case, they are:
                </p>
                <div style="padding-left: 3em;">

                    <h4>Earthquake</h4>
                    <p>
                        The earthquake is an ability that deals damage to enemies and pushes them away from the player,
                        creating a shield of rocks and difficult terrain around Itzel. This skill was
                        inspired by the Earth Mother and fertility goddess of Inca mythology Pachamama, which embodies
                        the mountains and causes earthquakes. Its main use is not
                        only to damage enemies but to gain protection from ranged attacks or secure some time as melee
                        enemies would have to find another path or break the
                        newly created obstacle. The process in mind when designing it was to give the player some kind
                        of survivability as they would be playing as one vs many.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Meteor Fall</h4>
                    <p>
                        The meteor fall is a short-range ability that deals massive damage, burns enemies in a large
                        area, and destroys the obstacles hit. This skill was inspired by Ishtar
                        the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility. This skill is meant to be used
                        against a group of enemies or to open paths that would be
                        inaccessible otherwise. The design for this ability was quite simple, the game required some
                        kind of powerful attack to kill multiple enemies, so I created
                        a short-range explosive spell, that would also modify the environment, as a meteor falling to
                        the ground would have a big effect in the area around it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Tornado</h4>
                    <p>
                        The tornado is an ability that deals low damage and pushes all the enemies around it. This skill
                        was inspired by Hadad the storm and rain god in the ancient
                        Mesopotamian religions. The tornado´s main use is to displace enemies into obstacles to damage or
                        kill them. For example, the player could instantly kill
                        a strong enemy by making it fall into a canyon. The process behind this skill was to create
                        something that made the player interact with the environment and use it to its advantage, enabling various playstyles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Holy Smite</h4>
                    <p>
                        The holy smite is a long-range ability that damages enemies and lowers their defense, moreover, it
                        ignores obstacles in its trajectory, as it´s literal lightning falling from the sky. This 
                        skill was inspired by Inanna the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of fertility and enforcer of 
                        divine justice. This ability was the last one to be made, and while doing so, I realized how the
                        player was missing a long-range attack or in general an action to make when enemies were still far away.
                        For this reason, I opted for a long-range spell that debuffed enemies.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </br>
            <p>
                After the abilities were done I needed to design various obstacles to fill the game grid with something other than walls and covers
                and give a reason to the player to interact with the environment. Since my programmers already did the code for damage-over-time effects for the player´s abilities,
                 I decided to build upon them and add new effects with similar behaviours, so that I could modify them myself.
                 I ended up creating over 10 different obstacles with distinctive effects, pointy walls that would make enemies bleed, columns that could be 
                 broken and stun enemies hit by the rubble, terrains that would slow or damage enemies, boulders that could be pushed and knock away enemies and so on.
            </p>
        </br>
                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p>
                    While I worked on the player´s abilities and obstacles, my colleagues had designed 3 enemies with different
                    behaviours, and as soon as these elements were established in the game I started planning our levels.
                    I was the main level designer for the project. The first thing I did was to study our main
                    references(XCOM, Warhammer Mechanicus) and try to understand their process and goals when creating a level.
                    Both of our references included controlling various allies while in our game we played as a single unit, so I had
                    to be mindful of the enemy placement in the level, their range, and movement speed. (Worth noting that after many 
                    playtests we decided to add familiars as sub-units to help Itzel in her fight) Now that I knew my constraints, 
                    before starting to create mockups for the levels, I decided to write the goals and context that the levels should follow.
                    Some levels focused on teaching certain mechanics to the player; others would focus on pure combat and non-linearity, giving multiple routes to the player, 
                    to choose their favourite playstyle; another level would focus on puzzle solving, such as finding and activating all the altars in the level to
                    open the exit door and escape the enemy patrols.
                </p>

                <h2>System Design</h2>
                <p>
                    After working on the abilities, levels, and obstacles, it was time to balance them. As the designer that created most of those elements,
                    I playtested for many hours to discern if those mechanics provided the experience I wanted for our players, and while I was at it, I also
                    created a document for discovered bugs, with a guide on how to replicate them and a possible solution. Moreover, as this was a 
                    school project, each week other students would playtest our game, so I prepared a form for them to compile and another document to collect all that
                    valuable feedback.
                    Thanks to the playtest, we realized many issues with the core loop and the balancing of the game. The game went through many changes,
                    for example at first we used AP(action points) to use our abilities, but we decided to change that resource in HP(health point) to display even
                    better our core pillar <b>Sacrifice</b>. With that update other problems arose, as we would be using our life for each spell thrown at the enemies,
                    so we introduced a healing mechanic when the player killed an enemy with a melee attack. In addition, I tweaked the player and enemies´ max HP and
                    attack damage until the game reached the desired feel.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project has been an important lesson. It was my and most of the group's first game in Unreal Engine, and we ended overscoping a bit too much.
                    Even so, we learned a lot, and my contributions to the project were wide-spanning and focused a lot on both the team and my individual work.
                    I had the chance to focus on what I want to specialize in, that being Gameplay and System design.
                    Moreover, I ended up having to take a lot of responsibility for the game, which I did not mind, and step in to help wherever we were
                    struggling in the process.
                    Our scope might have been too big for Sycle, resulting in a small demo rather than the complete game we desired, but it was a fun experience 
                    and a good lesson for the future.

                    <p>
                        Wonder Wings is a 3D flying shooting game. The player controls a plushie, with the goal to defeat all of the enemies in the room, 
                        mostly toys themselves, without crashing into obstacles.
                        <br><br>
                        With this game, we wanted to fill a hole in the market left by the absence of space shooters at the time, but instead of spaceships
                         we ended using toys for artistic constraints. Knowing our new target audience, we pushed for a toony and colorful aesthetic and a 
                         relaxing experience that everyone could enjoy.

                <p>
                    The journey of this nine-week game project turned out to be as much a test of effective
                    collaboration as it was about creating
                    an immersive gaming experence. With a team size much larger than what any of us were used to, we had
                    to put more focus on efficient
                    communication and teamwork. It was difficult at times, but we managed to pull together and create a
                    game I feel proud to have been a part of.
                </p>
                <h4>User Experience and User Interface Design</h4>
                <div class="burglar-show">
                    <video autoplay controls muted>
                        <source src="images/Burglar-Clipboard-Showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            My main responsibility was designing and implementing the User Interface.
                            Note that I'm going to lump UX in with UI as I worked with both fluidly. Yes, they are
                            different
                            disciplines, yes I'll do it anyway.
                            <br>
                            A couple of specific principles dictated my choices for the UI.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>First off, I decided that I wanted it to be diegetic. As diegetic as I could make it.
                            </li>
                            <li>Second, I wanted to minimize clutter in the UI as much as possible.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        So why make it diegetic? Well, interacting with a physical object rather than some weird
                        floating text
                        boxes tends to feel more natural in a VR environment. Not only can this help reduce motion
                        sickness,
                        it also adds to the immersion of the game.
                        <br><br>
                        Alright, but what do I mean by "minimize clutter"? By clutter I mean disorganized and/or
                        overcomplicated UI.
                        It can be confusing and overwhelming for the player if too much information is displayed in one
                        space.
                        But, it can also be irritating if the UI isn't easily accessible when the player needs it. This
                        can turn out
                        to be a bit of a balancing act, where readability and conciseness often compete with
                        comprehensiveness.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose to combine the Menus and the Mission Information UI into a physical object that the
                        player always
                        carries with them, a Clipboard. Everything that the player could need on the fly is centralized
                        in this single
                        location. This way, the player has only a single object they need to keep track of for the most
                        important UI,
                        and it's always right on their person when they need it. I chose specifically a Clipboard
                        because it makes intuitive
                        sense for important information to be on them. This worked out well as all our playtesters
                        instinctively referred to
                        it for menus and information even without being prompted to.
                        <br><br>
                        Actually creating the Clipboard, which I wanted to behave like an actual clipboard, presented
                        some challenges.
                        To keep it looking as natural as possible, I wanted the pages to flip and contort like paper
                        would.
                        In order to interact with the UI, I would need a Widget (Unreal's UI elements) to lay against
                        the page of the clipboard.
                        The page serves as a backdrop, and the Widget allows us to interact, so we now have a menu on a
                        clipboard, right?
                        Well, yes, but actually no. Since Widgets are projected on a flat plane, the widget cannot
                        contort with our pages
                        as they bend and flip over. Widgets just don't bend like that. But I need the widgets, because a
                        regular mesh (like a page)
                        can't be interacted with like UI. And if I just remove the Widget when the page turns, then the
                        page will turn white as it flips.
                        Not very realistic, is it? I needed the visuals of the Widget to stay on the page even as the
                        page turned over.
                        <br><br>
                        I looked around online for a few days but could not find any methods for how to accomplish this.
                        I don't know, maybe
                        I'm the first to ever have this issue. My solution was to utilize something called
                        SceneCaptureComponents and RenderTargets
                        alongside Dynamic Materials. Right above my page I put a WidgetComponent, the actual UI itself.
                        Above it, a SceneCaptureComponent2D
                        sits in wait for a signal. As I flip the page, the SceneCapture takes a picture of the Widget.
                        This picture is broadcast to a
                        RenderTarget2D, basically storing the visual information of the UI. I pass this RenderTarget's
                        texture to a Dynamic Material
                        which I can apply to the page's mesh. I can then safely remove the Widget, and the page will
                        look identical.
                        <br>
                        In summary; I take a photo of the UI and stick that onto the page as it flips, thus making it
                        look like the UI contorts.
                        <br><br>
                        I worked closely with artist (and part-time speed demon) Felicia to create all the functional
                        elements such as the meshes and
                        animations needed for the clipboard, as my technique requires very exact tolerances. We also
                        worked together to make the
                        icons for the UI.
                        <br><br>
                        Designing and programming the clipboard UI was an iterative and arduous process, spanning nearly
                        the entire project.
                        It was a fun learing experience and I'm proud of the end result.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Project Coordination</h4>
                <p>
                    As one of the main coordinators in the team, I helped direct the workflow, ensuring our efforts were
                    organized and productive.
                    I helped our code wizard Casper in handling any technical issues we faced with Unreal, as well as
                    designing and programming a comprehensive save system.
                    This role allowed me to balance resources, manage timelines, and harmonize our efforts.
                </p>
                <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                <p>
                    The task of spotting and fixing bugs, ensuring that our final product was as smooth and immersive as
                    possible, was a responsibility I embraced.
                    From coordinating playtesting sessions to refining the logic for saving and loading game data, these
                    behind-the-scenes contributions were essential
                    in enhancing the game's overall quality.
                </p>
                <h4>Sound Design and Game Environment Enhancement</h4>
                <p>
                    When a team member was absent for a long period of time, I had to fill in by working with and
                    implementing sound into the game.
                    This role stretched my skills and allowed me to add another layer of life to our game. It was a fun
                    change of pace from what I had been doing.
                    I worked on the dynamic walking sounds, the overall sound environment, and also designed and created
                    a hub area for the player.
                </p>
                <h4>Project Completion</h4>
                <p>
                    In the final stages of our project, I developed a system for unlockable cosmetics and a hover
                    display system for enhanced UI interaction.
                    My focus also involved refining the puzzles and win/lose conditions, ensuring they were engaging and
                    well-defined.
                    There were quite a few late nights, but it was a lot of fun.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout this nine-week project, I had the privilege of wearing many hats and contributing to
                    various aspects of our game.
                    The responsibilities I undertook were as much about the collective effort as my individual role.
                    Having to step in and help wherever we faced difficulties,
                    I am grateful for the many opportunities to learn and the opportunity to contribute in meaningful
                    ways.
                    The pride I feel is not just for the tasks I accomplished but more so for the successful result of
                    our teamwork and the rewarding journey we navigated together.

                <h2>My Team</h2>
                <p>
                    Through this nine week project I had the honor of working alongside the wonderful team Silent
                    Partner Interactive (SPI), a group of 14
                    other students from PSQ and 3 Sound and Media students from Högskolan Dalarna. I could not be more
                    proud of what we managed to accomplish together,
                    and I couldn't have asked for better teammates to experience this game project with.
                    <br><br>
                    For their hard work and their commitment, I am truly grateful. The game wouldn't have been anywhere
                    near what it is today without it.
                    I cannot thank all of them enough for the nine weeks we had together; it was a truly wonderful
                    experience even through the ups and downs.
                    In spite of the bugs, the crashing packages (%#¤%@!) and broken navmesh's, we delivered a really
                    freakin' solid game.
                    And of that, I am proud.
                    <br><br>
                    In fighting through the high amount of absences that we undfortunately had to deal with, those that
                    were present showed tremendous heart and effort.
                    Eventhough it was difficult, and eventhough it was unfair, the team pushed through together and
                    worked tirelessly to create the best game we could.
                    <br><br>
                    I remember one time, in particular, when we were very stressed for time and my office neighbour
                    Melinda was busy implementing sounds. Suddenly,
                    she put her hands in her face before looking to me with a panicked expression. The sound effects had
                    all started making strange noises!
                    They sounded muffled and they were crackling! I scooted over to her and tried her headset on; and
                    she was right! Something sounded very off.
                    When I went back to my computer to check if the issue was present in my version of the project too,
                    everything sounded perfectly fine on my end.
                    Melinda feared she would have to reimplement all the sound effects, which would take several hours.
                    Things were not looking good.
                    After some more panic, Melinda realize what the issue was. She hadn't plugged her headphones in
                    properly.
                    That was the only reason that the sound effects were strange.
                    In a mixture of embarrasment and relief, she cried for a couple of seconds before we both burst out
                    laughing.
                    <br><br>
                    There were some moments like those, where it felt like the team was actually more like a family. I
                    cannot express enough how much
                    I appreciate everybody's hard work. Their unwavering support, endless creativity, and unyielding
                    work ethic helped shape Burglar
                    into the experience it is today.
                    While the completion of the game marked the end of an intense journey, it was also the start of
                    countless new ones.
                    I am proud of what we have accomplished and looking forward to our next adventures.

                    <p>
                        Edge of Divinity is an intense top-down 2D slasher where players must maintain their momentum to
                        exceed.
                        The game puts players in control of a character armed with a sword, with the core mechanic
                        focusing on
                        precise sword swinging to damage enemies. The amount of damage inflicted by the sword is
                        determined by
                        the velocity and momentum of the swing, creating a satisfying and skill-based gameplay
                        experience.
                        <br><br>
                        During the whole process of creating this game, my focus has been on refining the core mechanic,
                        that of
                        momentum-based swordplay. My goal was to make it look, feel and behave just how I wanted it, to
                        make sure
                        that the foundation was incredibly solid. I am very pleased with what I have thus far been able
                        to put together!

                <h2>An ongoing project</h2>
                <h4>Concept</h4>
                <p>
                    Edge of Divinity is an intense top-down 2D game where players must maintain their momentum to
                    exceed. The game puts players in control of a character armed with a sword, with the core mechanic
                    focusing on precise sword swinging to damage enemies. The amount of damage inflicted by the sword is
                    determined by the velocity and momentum of the swing, creating a satisfying and skill-based gameplay
                    experience.
                </p>
                <h4>My Plan</h4>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, I wanted to put my time into making the main mechanic behave and feel the way I
                    wanted it to. I expected the biggest challenge in this would be making the momentum change feel
                    impactful and satisfying to the player, which turned out to be correct. Once I was satisfied with
                    the feel of core mechanics, I would look into adding more content where I felt it would improve the
                    experience.
                </p>
                <h4>Thought Process</h4>
                <p>
                    My core philosophy throughout the project has been trying to minimize the complexity of the game
                    whilst maximizing the skill ceiling and skill expression. I want the gist of the gameplay to be
                    easily understood within your first minute of playing, but I want your tenth hour of playing to
                    still feel satisfying and captivating.
                    <br><br>
                    The main mechanic of the game is a somewhat novel mouse-based movement system which I have found to
                    be quickly understood even by uninitiated players. It’s simple enough to pick up on the fly and
                    understand, and reliable enough to perform how the player expects it to. The nature of the game
                    itself, putting a lot of emphasis on momentum, makes gameplay fast-paced and requires the player to
                    act on split-second decisions to perform optimally.
                    <br><br>
                    The playtesters I’ve been lucky enough to have aiding me through this process have given me a lot of
                    suggestions for additions to the game. “What if you could keep a combo up even after a dash by using
                    the Pivot ability”, “You should make slashing enemy bullets should also activate the lunge”,
                    “Couldn’t the walls bounce you back when you dash into them?”, etc. I have carefully considered
                    these suggestions but ultimately only implemented a select few of them.
                    <br><br>
                    I considered things such as <span class="highlight">consistency</span>: making sure that the game
                    behaves how the player expects it to, <span class="highlight">encouraging playmaking</span>: being
                    careful to reward specifically non-stale play, which keeps the game exciting, and <span
                        class="highlight">quality of life</span>: trying to keep a smooth and satisfying experience for
                    the player.
                    <br><br>
                    Returning to a previous example, let’s say that slashing enemy projectiles gave the same effect as
                    slashing an enemy (the ability to lunge). This change might be <span
                        class="highlight">consistent</span> with the notion that slashing things activates the lunge,
                    <span class="underscore">but</span> it would also be <span class="highlight">encouraging</span> the
                    player to keep projectile enemies alive, as doing so would result in greater manoeuvrability and
                    speed, both of which are highly desirable.
                    <br>
                    I decided that I did not want keeping enemies alive to be the most effective way to play the game,
                    and so I made the decision not to include this particular change.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the playtesting, a lot of players expressed that the game felt highly satisfying… until you
                    missed a strike. Doing so left you barreling toward who-knows-where, unable to do anything to
                    rectify the unfortunate situation. While the goal of the game is of course not to make the player
                    feel <span class="underscore">unsatisfied</span>, I was also struggling to find a good solution for
                    this. If messing up had no consequence, good play would feel less rewarding as a result. This is
                    where the suggestion of bouncy walls surrounding the arena presented a <span class="highlight">great
                        quality of life</span> improvement. Though this is not <span class="highlight">consistent</span>
                    with the other walls, giving these specific walls a different look let players know that there was
                    something special about them. I didn’t want to <span class="highlight">encourage</span> the player
                    to go for hail marys across the stage, so I made you lose 20% of your speed when you bounce.
                </p>
                <h4>Priorities of my first four weeks</h4>
                <p>
                    Just as I had planned to do, I put the bulk of my effort into the main mechanic of the game: dashing
                    and slashing. My biggest priority throughout the project was, and is, to make sure that this feels
                    responsive and satisfying to the player. For this reason, I have also put some time into making VFX
                    to support the look and feel of the bladework. Adding these VFX made the game look and feel more
                    fluid and also helped with readability, making for a sizable improvement.
                    <br><br>
                    My reasoning behind this is simple. I feel that a solid core mechanic allows the game to remain
                    uncomplicated and elegant in it’s design while still having intricacy and depth for the player to
                    improve and grow in. It also gives me a very solid base to expand on the game from, should I wish
                    to. I could make any number of gamemodes for this specific game later on.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, I was not able to create a complete game in the timeframe. I am, however, very happy
                    with the proof of concept I have made, and would say that the game is currently in a sort of “beta”
                    state. Though it does not have all the polish I would have hoped, it is fully functional, and I am
                    very happy with the state of the slash- and dash mechanic.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to skip on creating things like an options menu, background music, art and such “fluff” as
                    I like to call it. While the fluff is absolutely a relevant (and indeed quite important) factor for
                    finished games, I was not willing to skimp on the core mechanics of the game to prioritize such
                    aspects within these four weeks. I had plans to implement temporary sound effects, enemy models,
                    environments for everything that would benefit from it, as well as plans to make a more appealing
                    HUD and menus, but never found the time. Rather, I focused on the core of the game.
                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project, I have made deliberate design choices to ensure that the core mechanics
                    shine, even at the expense of adding "fluff" elements such as background music or extensive visual
                    assets. While these aspects were not prioritized within the project's scope, they remain
                    opportunities for future development and polish.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking ahead, I see immense potential for expanding 'Edge of Divinity' into a more complete and
                    fully realized game. The foundation I have established provides a solid base for adding additional
                    content, such as new game modes, enemy types, and environments, that could further enhance the
                    gameplay experience.
                    <br><br>
                    'Edge of Divinity' stands as a proof of concept, a testament to the joy of precise swordplay, and a
                    stepping stone towards the realization of a fully-fledged game that captures the essence of becoming
                    a godlike force of tranquil destruction.

                    <source src="images/eod/1-Spinning.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Your cursor dictates the direction
                    your sword faces. Meaning: your
                    sword points where you point.
                </p>
                <h4 class="eod-segment">Damage</h4>
                <video controls muted class="eod-tutorial">
                    <source src="images/eod/2-Damage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    The faster you swing, the more damage
                    your slashes deal. Increasing your character's
                    speed also increases this damage!
                </p>
                <h4 class="eod-segment">Lunge</h4>
                <video controls muted class="eod-tutorial">
                    <source src="images/eod/3-Lunge.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    When a glowing white circle appears at your
                    feet, you can activate a
                    <span class="highlight">"Lunge"</span>.
                    When you stand still,
                    <span class="highlight">Lunging</span>
                    sends you flying forwards with a burst of speed.
                    After a short while, you will start
                    slowing down unless you hit a new target.
                </p>
                <h4 class="eod-segment">Targets</h4>
                <video controls muted class="eod-tutorial">

                </video>
                <p>
                    Successfully slashing a target creates a
                    slowly closing white circle at your feet,
                    indicating that you can perform a
                    <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>
                    as long as the circle persists.
                    Activating the
                    <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>
                    gives you a speed boost and sends you
                    flying toward the direction of your sword.
                </p>
                <h4 class="eod-segment">Pivot</h4>
                <video controls muted class="eod-tutorial">

                </video>
                <p>
                    You also have the ability
                    <span class="highlight">Pivot</span>, which is
                    a way to "fake" a hit (that means it activates your
                    <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>!).
                </p>
                <h4 class="eod-segment">Combos</h4>
                <video controls muted class="eod-tutorial">

                </video>
                <p>
                    You are able to slash several targets with a single swing.
                    Whenever you hit a second target before the prior
                    one's white <span class="highlight">Lunge</span>
                    circle dissapears, your
                    <span class="highlight">Combo</span> counter increases.
                    <span class="highlight">Lunging</span> while you have an
                    active <span class="highlight">Combo</span> will end it -
                    and grant you a significant speed boost increasing with
                    the number of hits in the
                    <span class="highlight">Combo</span>.
